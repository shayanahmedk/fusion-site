This Privacy Policy applies to the information TeleDirect collects from its customers at www.teledirect.com (the \u201cSite\u201d) in connection with the services we provide. This Privacy Policy discloses our practice with respect to the collection and subsequent use of our customers\u2019 personal information. This Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Tele-Direct does not own or control, or to people that Tele-Direct does not employ or manage.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Information Collection and Use<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We do not collect personal information about you unless you choose to provide that information to us or you choose a service on this Site where gathering personal information is necessary in order to deliver the specific services. We only collect the information that we actually need. Some of that is information that you actively give us when you sign up for an account, register for an event, ask for customer support, or use any other services offered by us. If you voluntarily contact us regarding Tele-Direct services, we may collect the following categories of personal information: your name, company name, telephone number, email address and mailing address, as well as a login name and password. When you create a new account within one of our three platforms, Seminar Edge\u2122, Work The Lead\u2122, and TUFC\u2122, we again collect personal information from you including your name, company name, telephone number, email address and mailing address. Further, when you create a new campaign or seminar and are ready to begin using our services, we collect billing information such as billing name, billing address, and credit card number.<\/p>\n<p>The personal information we collect from you will be used by Tele-Direct to provide the service or carry out the transaction you have requested or authorized. This may include using the personal information to provide you with important information about the product or service that you are using, including critical updates and notifications via e-mail or regular mail. In addition, Tele-Direct may share or transfer information about you that you have provided to Tele-Direct to one or more third party entities pursuant to a sale, merger, assignment, joint venture or other transfer or disposition of a portion, or all of, the assets or stock of Tele-Direct.<\/p>\n<p>In some instances, we may include certain links in our e-mails that will allow us to monitor whether you access specific content in that e-mail. When you click on one of these links, we will record that click and certain activities on the Site associated with that link. We use this information to conduct internal research on our users\u2019 demographics and interests, and to better serve you. This information is collected in aggregate form and is not related to your personally identifiable information.<\/p>\n<p>We use log files to track system activity and maintain our systems. Log data includes IP addresses, browser type, referring and exit pages, platform type, date and time stamps, and number and nature of clicks through our Site.

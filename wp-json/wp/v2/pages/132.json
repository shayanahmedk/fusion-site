TeleDirect and its affiliates provide their services to you subject to the following Terms of Use. Before you may use TeleDirect's services, you must read and accept all of the following Terms of Use.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Privacy<\/h2>\n<p>TeleDirect is committed to the protection of our customers' privacy. For a complete description of how we collect and subsequently use our customers' personal information, including the security measures we have implemented to protect the data, please review our Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Phone Numbers<\/h2>\n<p>After purchasing your package of customer service you will select a phone number(s) to use in connection with your account. These phone numbers are and will always remain the property of TeleDirect Communications Inc. All usage of these numbers is at the sole discretion of TeleDirect Communications Inc. TeleDirect will deduct minutes for unused phone numbers. You may cancel a campaign at any time and avoid this deduction. 29 minutes will be deducted every 30 days for any phone number that has no usage. For example, if a phone number has 24 minutes of usage in 30 days, 5 minutes will be deducted from your balance of minutes.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Auto Protect<\/h2>\n<p>All accounts are required to enter a credit card number and keep it on file in your secure account for the Auto Protect system. The package you select will be automatically charged when your account is low in minutes. If your average daily usage of minutes indicates you will run out of minutes within 3 days, or you are below 50 minutes left in your account, the package you had selected will be charged overnight to your credit card on file. Advanced notification of your minute balance will be provided via email to indicate low minutes, totaling three (3) email notifications prior to any credit card charges. Accounts are not allowed to run into negative balances. If your account goes negative during the course of a day you will be charged for the negative balance amount plus your Auto Protect package amount.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Service<\/h2>\n<p>The minute package purchased from TeleDirect Communications Inc. is valid for the duration of the campaign and\/or for future campaigns should a minute balance remain on the account. The minutes purchased expire two years from the date of purchase. Fees paid for set up, training, custom reports and technology integration are non-refundable. TeleDirect provides a refund of unused and unexpired minutes upon request. Upon termination of services, any refund requested of the payments made in the first month will be subject to a 20% service fee and the balance on the account will be eligible for refund.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>\u00a0Client Charges and Rate Plans<\/h2>\n<p>The initial set up fees paid covers up to two (2) hours of set up, project design, training and scripting. Additional hours needed beyond the included hours for scripting will be billed at $150.00 per hour. Additional hours needed beyond the included hours for training will be billed at $27 per hour per agent. Specific technology integrations will also be billed at $150 per hour. Standard reporting is included free of charge. Custom reporting designed for a client will be billed at $150 per hour. A deduction of 30 minutes per holiday will apply to your account for New Year\u2019s Day, President\u2019s Day, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Credit Card Charge Backs or Holds<\/h2>\n<p>The charge on your credit card statement will appear as Tele-Direct Communications. If you request a charge back of this payment from your credit card company your account will be immediately disabled and your phone number(s) will be released. To restore your account, you must have the credit card charge back or hold removed and TeleDirect will then apply a $25.00 processing fee. Once your account has been disabled and your phone number(s), there is no guarantee that you will be able to use the same phone number(s).<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Registration<\/h2>\n<p>Upon registration with TeleDirect, you will choose a User Name and Password for your account.

In an increasingly fluid and global business environment, it helps to speak the language of your clientele \u2013 figuratively and literally.<\/p>\n<p>Bilingual answering services are just one way that companies have leveraged business process outsourcing (BPO) capability to strengthen existing ties and foster brand-new business relationships.

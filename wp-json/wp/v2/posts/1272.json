The relationships between patients and caregivers \u2013 doctors, nurses, aides, and countless other providers \u2013 are the foundation of positive, meaningful healthcare experiences.<\/p>\n<p>And that\u2019s precisely why some healthcare organizations are reluctant to implement virtual contact centers.

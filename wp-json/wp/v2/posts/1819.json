One of the most striking is the relationship many people have with their work and career. After working remotely during the lockdown, lots of folks prefer this style to the old norm of commuting to an office. While working from home is not possible for all types of careers or positions, many companies continue to encourage employees to work from home if they wish. This has had a significant impact on a lot of industries. In the call center industry, it\u2019s been great. We\u2019ve been able to help companies of all sectors continue to serve customers and run smoothly, even when their physical doors have been shut.<\/p>\n<p>Are you hoping to transition into a full-time work-from-home role? One of the best careers for remote work is with a call center. In fact, at TeleDirect, we offer our team <a href=\"https:\/\/www.teledirect.com\/join-our-team\/\">work-from-home flexibility.<\/a> We believe it facilitates a better work-life balance\u2014and that\u2019s important. In fact, we believe that flexible staffing models are one of the most important trends in the WFH world right now. We\u2019ve explained why and highlighted a few other current trends we love below. If you have any questions, be sure to reach out to our team. We want to hear from you.<\/p>\n<h3>Flexible Staffing Models for Call Center Workers<\/h3>\n<p>We\u2019re all different\u2014and modern companies recognize that in their employees. These days, not everybody can work typical business hours or commute to a faraway office. That\u2019s why we believe that flexible staffing models are better for everybody involved.<\/p>\n<p>Flexible working conditions provide a better overall work experience for employees. With these models, workers\u2019 valuable time and hard work feel appreciated. This is ideal for several reasons. First, it shows you care about your employees\u2019 well-being, and this is a way to show it. Secondly, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.teledirect.com\/business-solutions\/work-from-home-work-for-healthy-company-culture\/\">happy and satisfied employees<\/a> are more likely to enjoy their job (and not get poached by another company). This will lead to a better reputation as an employer, giving you access to a broader pool of talent when you need it.<\/p>\n<h3>Deeper Investment in Technology Solutions<\/h3>\n<p>What do you think this is, the \u201860s? While the old days of giant computers and stationery technology might have required employees to work from an office or lab, this is no longer necessary in many industries. Your company\u2019s call center can run without an office space\u2014all you need is to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.teledirect.com\/services\/call-center-platform\/\">invest in the right technology.<\/a> These types of solutions include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>AI<\/li>\n<li>Cloud storage<\/li>\n<li>Analytics<\/li>\n<li>Automated Services<\/li>\n<li>Virtual Communication Apps and Tools<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Increase in Productivity and Quality Assurance<\/h3>\n<p>You will likely see more productive performances by offering your team members more flexible working conditions. This is for several reasons. First, by providing flexible and fair work hours to your staff, you will likely see more loyalty and desire to perform well from them. Secondly, you are granting your team more time by removing complicated factors like commuting or even dressing in professional clothing. This extra time makes a big difference to their overall well-being and energy levels, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.teledirect.com\/business-solutions\/best-practices-for-call-center-quality-assurance\/\">which will show in their performance<\/a>. Finally, flexible schedules allow employees to work when they can without worrying about external factors (like making it through rush-hour traffic to pick the kids up from daycare before it closes).<\/p>\n<h3>Customer Service Automation<\/h3>\n<p>At TeleDirect, we are big fans of live agent services within all call centers. That being said, we always advocate for implementing a few automated services to your strategy to streamline things. A simple automated service (such as \u201cpress 1 for ___ department) can help keep things moving and ensure that everyone&#8217;s calls land in the right spot. These services are also great for providing \u201cevergreen\u201d answers, like giving business hours or renewing a subscription. By incorporating these automated services into your overall plan, you can provide your customers with better coverage, save money and offer a more efficient call center.<\/p>\n<h3>Remote Training and Resources for Call Center Agents<\/h3>\n<p>Remote training is surging in popularity across all industries. To us, it\u2019s a natural solution and translates perfectly to the call center and customer service industries. You have a more scalable and flexible solution for new or potential employees by training your call center agents remotely. Not only will that make you more attractive as an employer, but your trainees will also be able to learn your company values in a way that is comfortable for them. This will make the entire training process feel more natural and comfortable. It\u2019s also a great way to stay within your budget\u2014you won\u2019t need to rent a training space.<\/p>\n<h3>Outsourced Solutions<\/h3>\n<p>If you run your call center at home, you must be prepared for any volume of an incoming communication. If your demand is outpacing your capacity, don\u2019t sweat. Work-from-home outsourcing is the best and most effective way to tackle this problem.

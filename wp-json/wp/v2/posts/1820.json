If you are a business interested in establishing a toll-free number or looking for a professional customer call center service, we\u2019re here to help.<\/p>\n<h2>What and where is the 855 area code?<\/h2>\n<p>So, perhaps you\u2019ve received a call from an 855 area code lately. Do you know where area code 855 is located? If you\u2019re stumped, don\u2019t worry. It\u2019s a trick question. While the 855 area code is within the U.S., it is not state-specific\u2014it\u2019s a toll-free number. This means that your call might have come from anywhere\u2014from Alabama to Minnesota. This also means that if you want to call them back, you can do so from anywhere in the United States, as long as it\u2019s done using a landline.<\/p>\n<h2>What is a toll-free number, and how does it work?<\/h2>\n<p>As we mentioned earlier, 855 is a toll-free number. These phone numbers have existed for a long time and are typically used by businesses and companies, not individual households. That\u2019s because toll-free numbers have a true purpose\u2014to help companies serve many more customers. Since a toll-free number (like 855) allows callers across America to contact a business without paying fees, they encourage more customers to reach out when they have a question or concern. This forges a better overall relationship between the client and the brand.<\/p>\n<h3>How are toll-free numbers (like phone code 855) assigned?<\/h3>\n<p>Toll-free numbers are assigned by professional organizations like the Federal Communications Commission, or the FCC, with the help of \u201cresponsible organizations,\u201d who can access a database of available toll-free numbers. However, businesses can request specific phone numbers if they wish. This will depend on whether the number is already in use.<\/p>\n<h2>855 area code USA: Is it my only toll-free option?<\/h2>\n<p>No! There are quite a few different toll-free area codes available in the United States. These area codes are 800, 888, 877, 866, 855, 844 and 833.<\/p>\n<p>Please note that while these are all toll-free numbers, they can\u2019t be used interchangeably. Let\u2019s say you run a spa business with a \u201cvanity\u201d phone number: 1-855-RELAX ME. If your customer dials 1-866-RELAX ME, they won\u2019t reach you. They\u2019ll reach whoever has the number 1-866-735-2963. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to emphasize your 855 area code: this isn\u2019t the old days when most toll-free numbers were 800.<\/p>\n<h2>Are there benefits of using an 855 number?<\/h2>\n<p>There are many benefits to using toll-free numbers. We do not believe that specific toll-free numbers hold any more value over others, although 800 tends to be more recognizably \u201ctoll-free\u201d than the others.<\/p>\n<p>Some of the biggest benefits of using a toll-free number for your company include the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h3>Better Customer Service<\/h3>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>A toll-free number allows your customers to quickly and affordably contact your business when needed: no fuss, no hidden charges and no location restrictions. This provides a much better overall customer service experience and leads to more satisfied customers returning to your services and praising you.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h3>Wider Range of Clients<\/h3>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Who says all of your customers need to be local? It\u2019s 2023! Open your brand up to a broader range of leads and customers by offering a toll-free number. It will remove all the location-based restrictions and give customers across the United States an equal chance to fall in love with your product.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h3>Memorable Contact Information<\/h3>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Many brands choose something called a \u201cvanity number.\u201d This refers to a catchy toll-free number that correlates to your brand. An example we gave earlier was 1-855-RELAX ME for a spa. A real-life example of this is the popular florist brand 1-800-FLOWERS.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h3>Professionalism<\/h3>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Toll-free area codes are recognizably different from home or cellphone numbers. By listing a toll-free number as your contact information rather than a local one, your brand instantly looks more professional and businesslike.<\/p>\n<h2>Prefix and area code: What\u2019s the difference?<\/h2>\n<p>An area code is the first part of a phone number. In terms of toll-free numbers, that\u2019s the part that begins with an \u201c8.\u201d For home numbers, that is the portion that varies depending on location. For example, Boston\u2019s area code is 617. The next part of the phone number sequence is called a prefix. This is less fixed by location and is three digits.<\/p>\n<h2>How to get an 855 number for your business<\/h2>\n<p>Ready to start taking calls through an 855 number?

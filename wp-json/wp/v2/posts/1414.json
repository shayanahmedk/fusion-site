While the virus hasn\u2019t gone away, society has learned to live with it in all sorts of ways we never even imagined back in the shocking spring of 2020. While some of these changes have been challenging, others have ended up feeling preferable to the \u201cold ways.\u201d A great example of this? Telemedicine.<\/p>\n<p>While telemedicine began to popularize as a response to an international emergency, it\u2019s become a silver lining of the pandemic for many people across the globe. In the early days, it was key for protection. It helped prevent hospitals from becoming overloaded, curbed the spread of the virus, and kept healthcare providers safe during a time when their services were as imperative as ever.<\/p>\n<p>Two years later, some wonder, \u201cis telemedicine here to stay, or was it only helpful during the pandemic?\u201d We think it\u2019s here to stay\u2026and here\u2019s why.<\/p>\n<h2>Telemedicine 2020: A New Frontier<\/h2>\n<p>When Covid struck, we were advised to avoid nearly all human contact. As a result, telemedicine surged in popularity\u2014 but it was a new experience for many. And by many, we mean many\u2014 according to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/mmwr\/volumes\/69\/wr\/mm6943a3.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CDC<\/a>, late March saw a rise of 154% in telemedicine appointments compared to the same time the previous year!<\/p>\n<h2>Telemedicine 2021: A Necessity<\/h2>\n<p>So much has changed in such a short period of time! While we often think of 2020 as the \u201cearly days\u201d of the pandemic, it\u2019s important to remember how different things were in 2021 compared to now. We knew much less about the virus back then, the vaccines were not as accessible, and many communities were affected badly or spent a lot of time on lockdown. These conditions made it so that telemedicine was a necessity for many.<\/p>\n<h2>Telemedicine 2022: A New Way of Life<\/h2>\n<p>In 2022, society has learned to live with Covid. Many people are getting on with their lives. We are traveling, attending in-person events, and mixing in groups. However, telemedicine continues to be a popular form of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.teledirect.com\/industries\/healthcare\/\">healthcare<\/a>\u2026and we understand why. It can be far more convenient and straightforward for both patients and providers alike. Plus, it is still a preferable choice for those more vulnerable to viruses.<\/p>\n<h2>Make the Most of Telehealth on the Rise<\/h2>\n<p>At TeleDirect, we have <a href=\"https:\/\/www.teledirect.com\/industries\/healthcare\/telehealth-call-center-services\">everything<\/a> needed to ensure that your healthcare provider service is communicating at top level.

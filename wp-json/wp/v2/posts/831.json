Human error, unreliable technology, and other hurdles ensured the first call center was no place to expect quick service!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Computer-Based Call Answering<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Mid 1950s<\/strong> \u2013 in the mid-20<sup>th<\/sup> century, a system called the Automatic Call Distributor (ACD) collected, routed, and assigned incoming calls to available agents. It wasn\u2019t the most effective or efficient method, but the present-day call center had its first prototype. The use of algorithms started the transition from switchboards to premise-based call centers.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>The Early Call Center Precursors<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Late 1950s \/ early 1960s<\/strong> \u2013 the blueprint for the modern call center was created with Private Automated Business Exchanges (known as PABX). Of course, PABX enterprises relied heavily on ACD technology.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>The 1-800 Era<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Late 1960s<\/strong> \u2013 to make call routing easier, AT&amp;T established 1-800 numbers in 1967. This allowed heavier call volumes, and also created unexpected advertising opportunities and marketing avenues.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>British Advancements \u2013 How to Answer the Telly 20,000 Times per Week<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early 1970s<\/strong> \u2013 British Gas used an ACD system to field up to 20,000 calls per week in a facility based in Wales. To date, this was the most calls any center had processed in a 7-day span.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Talking Robots (Sort of)<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>1970s<\/strong> \u2013 with Interactive Voice Response (IVR) technology, incoming calls could be handled by fully automated systems.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>To the Cloud (and Beyond)<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Mid 2000s \u2013 premise-based call center technology eventually ceded call center management to cloud-based systems. TeleDirect was one of the early pioneers in this field, with a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.teledirect.com\/value-results\/\">global cloud infrastructure<\/a> powered by Amazon Web Services and Twilio.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>There you have it \u2013 a brief history of call center technology. So the next time you reach out to a call center and receive prompt, customer-friendly service, thank those trailblazers like ACD, PABX, IVR and other technology for getting things headed in the right direction. If you still feel your business is operating out of a switchboard, it may be\u00a0time to seek professional help.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-832\" src=\"https:\/\/www.teledirect.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Teledirect-caveman-operating-switchboard-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"caveman-operating-switch-board-call-center-technology\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.teledirect.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Teledirect-caveman-operating-switchboard-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.teledirect.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Teledirect-caveman-operating-switchboard-150x150.jpg 150w, https:\/\/www.teledirect.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Teledirect-caveman-operating-switchboard-300x300.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.teledirect.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Teledirect-caveman-operating-switchboard-768x768.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>For a better brand of outsourced call center management, contact <a href=\"https:\/\/www.teledirect.com\/\">TeleDirect<\/a> today.

Fail to satisfy client demand, and your reputation is at stake \u2013 no matter how outrageous their demands.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s another business adage worth looking into: \u201cthe customer isn\u2019t always pleasant.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>When your business receives angry calls from customers (from real or perceived shortcomings in customer service), what is your plan of action?

Sometimes, there are no legitimate grievances. Other times, your products or services are clearly to blame. Whatever the root cause of their anger, it\u2019s best to keep these principles in mind:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Stay calm<\/strong>. Your customers are already frustrated. Adding another loud voice to the equation simply escalates the situation.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Listen &amp; repeat<\/strong>. Without understanding your customer\u2019s frustration, finding a solution is next to impossible. Keep an attentive ear to their concerns, and repeat your responses, if necessary. An angry customer isn\u2019t the most receptive customer. Sometimes, it helps to reinforce what your business is doing to rectify the situation. Bottom line: repeat as required.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Ensure a solution \u2013 or a plan to solve their problem<\/strong>. Discount vouchers, follow-up communication, upcoming product improvements \u2013 there are plenty of ways to make sure your angry customer goes away from the call satisfied. Not all problems are 100% solvable during a phone call, yet every issue demands 100% commitment from your customer service team.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Customer Communication No-Nos: Avoid these Phrases<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>When dealing with uneasy customers, what NOT to do is sometimes as important \u2013 or even more important \u2013 than what to do.<\/p>\n<p>There are a few hot-button statements you should certainly avoid on the phone with upset clients. Drum roll, please\u2026here are things you should never say to frustrated customers on the phone:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>\u201cPlease hold<\/strong>.\u201d When resolving customer issues, time is of the essence. When you tell a customer to hold while they\u2019re already upset, it just adds fuel to the fire. Instead, explain that your team is actively investigating the issue and will have a resolution soon. Here\u2019s an even smarter solution: sign up with TeleDirect\u2019s BPO <a href=\"https:\/\/www.teledirect.com\/services\/call-center-platform\/\">call center services<\/a> and enjoy optimal call routing, live agent assistance, and intuitive scripting resources to assist with unsure clients.<\/li>\n<li><strong>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing we can do right now.\u201d<\/strong> Nothing adds frustration more than admitting your business is helpless in the face of a client\u2019s problem. Instead, tell your customer that their issue is important, and your business will resolve accordingly.<\/li>\n<li><strong>\u201cWould you like to speak to my superior?\u201d<\/strong> This is the ultimate admittance that you\u2019re unable to assist at all. A customer doesn\u2019t want to feel like they\u2019re being passed over. Exhaust all resources before getting help from a manager.

At least within the e-commerce realm, today\u2019s online shoppers are an impatient bunch. Some want a response within an hour, but most customers are fine with a reply email within 24 hours. Go beyond a day to reply, and you risk losing business.<\/li>\n<li><strong>In-person consultation<\/strong>. Waiting for an actual person to handle client issues feels like forever sometimes. Yet many people are willing to wait 30 minutes or more to speak with a customer service representative face to face. With scheduled appointments, up to 24 hours is acceptable.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Online chat<\/strong>. One of the most popular modern contact methods, chat portals have grown exponentially over the past 5 years. One of the main reasons for chat\u2019s popularity is wait times; about half of all customers expect a reply within 60 seconds. And it\u2019s rare to find a client willing to wait with an unresponsive chat window \u2013 almost 95% of customers won\u2019t stay longer than 5 minutes.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Phone call<\/strong>. Remember the good old days, when an actual phone call was the preferred customer contact method?

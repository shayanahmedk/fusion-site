Most companies run at least some facets of their business digitally (think apps, websites, etc.) That\u2019s where your company\u2019s IT support center comes in. However, IT service is a massive industry and can be as complex as tech itself. This is why experts have broken it down into tiers.<\/p>\n<p>The IT support tier system is broken down into three primary sections: 1, 2 and 3. These tiers determine what type of service will be offered depending on the needs of the client or customer calling your contact center. In some cases, an agent might escalate (or even sometimes de-escalate) an issue to another tier to reach resolution.<\/p>\n<h2>The Tiers of IT Support<\/h2>\n<p>What are the main tiers of IT support?<\/p>\n<h3>Tier 1 IT Support<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.teledirect.com\/services\/inbound\/tier-1-tech-support\/\">Tier 1 IT support<\/a> refers to cases where basic customer assistance is needed. Tier 1 IT cases can be handled by agents who aren\u2019t necessarily specialized tech experts. Rather, Tier 1 agents are customer service professionals and work mainly with personalized scripts.<\/p>\n<p>If a Tier 1 agent is unable to reach a resolution, they will escalate the call to the next tier.<\/p>\n<h3>Tier 2 IT Support<\/h3>\n<p>Tier 2 IT support is more specialized and specific to the technological needs of your brand. This type of service will feature specialized agents who have trained extensively on the tech support details of your company and product(s). They will be able to offer individualized, expert support to your customers. However, in some cases, they still may not be able to reach resolution. In that case, they will escalate to Tier 3.<\/p>\n<h3>Tier 3 IT Support<\/h3>\n<p>This tier features highly skilled and knowledgeable support from professional technicians. In fact, Tier 3 IT support often calls on the firsthand knowledge of the masterminds behind your product, such as engineers and developers. They know the tech side of your service or product better than anyone else and are usually able to resolve the issue.<\/p>\n<h3>Tier 4 Support<\/h3>\n<p>In the unlikely case that Tier 3 support doesn\u2019t reach full resolution, it is often due to an external issue. In these cases, it is possible to escalate to Tier 4, where outside services or companies will need to be contacted.<\/p>\n<p>Some IT centers also include \u201cTier 0\u201d in their list. That refers to \u201cself-support,\u201d which can be carried out without live agent services\u2014like web searches, internet forums and FAQ pages.<\/p>\n<h2>The Benefits of an IT Help Desk<\/h2>\n<p>What are some of the biggest reasons to outsource an IT help desk for your company?<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Open availability.<\/strong> Tech is a 24\/7 industry. After all, your customers can and do use your products every day and at all hours. When they experience a technical malfunction, they need a knowledgeable professional to help them resolve it. Without this support, a small malfunction can quickly turn into a crisis. In these cases, it\u2019s not possible to wait until normal business hours to receive support and reach resolution. An outsourced help desk is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year.<\/li>\n<li><strong>More efficient team.<\/strong> By outsourcing an IT help desk, you can provide all the reassurance and support your customers need without stretching your existing team too thinly. After all, you hired them for specific skills completely unrelated to tech support and customer service. Let them focus on their actual jobs\u2014it will make a massive overall difference. After all, a happy, satisfied team performs much better than an overworked one.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Happier customers.<\/strong> If you\u2019ve ever had your day ruined by a malfunctioning product or unexplained tech issue, you know what a lifeline your IT help desk can be for your customers. When they experience a technical issue, they need dedicated support immediately\u2014and your help desk will provide just that. When they experience care and efficiency from your support team, they\u2019ll reach a resolution faster. That will help them walk away satisfied, even if their day began with a dramatic tech issue!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>What IT Support Tier Is Your Match?<\/h2>\n<p>Not sure which IT support tier is best for your business?

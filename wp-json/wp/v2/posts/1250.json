What separates automated call center services from live trained agents? Unique character. The ability to listen and understand. A decidedly human touch to an ever-increasingly robotized landscape. In other words, personality. Regardless of your call center agents\u2019 personality types, as long as they\u2019re solving problems for clients, you\u2019re good to go!<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>The ability to multitask<\/b>. Your call center is a multitasking wonder. Call center agents should match this flexible, adaptable ethic. From fielding queries to entering data, from creating practical solutions to scheduling follow-up communication, all call center agents need to do a dozen things \u2013 sometimes, simultaneously. That\u2019s why companies rely on TeleDirect to deliver top-notch live call center agents, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.teledirect.com\/industries\/\"><span class=\"s2\">regardless of their industry<\/span><\/a>.<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Crunch time characteristics<\/b>. Performing under pressure. Getting it done in crunch time. Whatever you call it, your call center agents need to be their best when external circumstances aren\u2019t. If something can go wrong, it will. Knowing how to navigate high pressure, under-the-gun episodes helps elevate extraordinary agents from also-rans.<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Knowledge about your products and services<\/b>. All call center representatives need to know the ins and outs of their business. This is one reason why some companies are hesitant to sign up with BPO solutions like TeleDirect. However, once they see how our agents understand their clients\u2019 services \u2013 whether <a href=\"https:\/\/www.teledirect.com\/industries\/healthcare\/\"><span class=\"s2\">healthcare products<\/span><\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.teledirect.com\/industries\/insurance\/\"><span class=\"s2\">insurance<\/span><\/a>, and more \u2013 they know they\u2019re getting knowledgeable assets with a team-first mentality. <\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>A positive outlook<\/b>. Ultimately, effective call center agents deliver solutions and solve problems. This is impossible without a true passion for doing what they love \u2013 and it starts with having a positive attitude! If your current call center service has everyone feeling that negative vibe, make the switch to TeleDirect.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Want the Best Call Center Agents?

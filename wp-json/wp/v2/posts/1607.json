Your products and marketing campaigns can only get you so far. For a booming business, you need a great reputation\u2014and that comes from good customer and lead experiences. The best way to provide this? By making sure that your customer service game is always on point.<\/p>\n<p>Today, we will cover some of the most important strategies to improve customer satisfaction, leading to a better reputation and word-of-mouth advertising and more leads walking through your doors!<\/p>\n<h2>Offer 24\/7 Coverage<\/h2>\n<p>Your dealership may close at a certain hour or on specific days, but your customers\u2019 needs may arise at any time. Whether your leads and customers choose an irregular time to make an appointment, experience a complication with their vehicle or have pressing questions for your team, a 24\/7 call center service will ensure that every one of those needs is met in a timely manner. At TeleDirect, we make this easy\u2014our outsourced call centers for auto services all have options for 24\/7 availability.<\/p>\n<h2>Provide Live Support<\/h2>\n<p>There are lots of times when automated support is exactly what customers need\u2014but not always. Sometimes, live agents are the most helpful and straightforward option for resolving issues, answering questions, escalating cases and checking in on customers and leads. When your customers receive individualized, live support, they feel seen\u2014that encourages them to return to your dealership again.<\/p>\n<p>At TeleDirect, we offer dedicated live <a href=\"\/services\/inbound\/\">inbound call support<\/a> for auto dealerships across the country.<\/p>\n<h2>Let Your Sales Team Focus on Their Job<\/h2>\n<p>Your sales team is doing an amazing job\u2014but when they also are expected to handle your customer support needs, their focus will be split. Overstretched employees cannot do their job properly\u2014and when that happens, both your sales and customer support game won\u2019t be at its best. To avoid this, let your sales team do their actual job\u2014sales\u2014 and invest in a dedicated outsourced customer support service instead.<\/p>\n<h2>Follow Up On Leads<\/h2>\n<p>Not following up on leads? You could be letting new customers slip between your fingers! When a customer is shopping for a new car, they are likely looking at several dealerships and considering their options. By following up with them, you are both reminding them about your excellent dealership and options as well as showing them that you remembered meeting them and care about getting them a great car.<\/p>\n<p>At TeleDirect, our dedicated <a href=\"\/services\/outbound\/\">outbound call support<\/a> amenities include <a href=\"\/services\/lead-response-management\/\">lead verification and qualification services<\/a> so you can ensure that more folks return to your dealership.<\/p>\n<h2>Provide Reliable Appointment Booking<\/h2>\n<p>While you may only be available for appointments during your chosen business hours, your leads and customers might decide to schedule one at any time. Rather than make them wait until you\u2019re fully operating, give them the chance to book their appointment exactly when the urge strikes, whether that\u2019s at 2 a.m. or on a Sunday night. Otherwise, they might go somewhere else and you\u2019ll never even meet them, let alone sell them a car!<\/p>\n<p>At TeleDirect, we offer dedicated reservation booking services, along with reminder and follow-up calls to make sure that no appointment is missed.<\/p>\n<h2>Stick to Your Branding<\/h2>\n<p>Your dealership is unique\u2014and your customer service needs to match it. If your salespeople are known for being friendly and helpful, your customer service must operate in the same way. Otherwise, clients can be disappointed with their customer service and not return. This same concept applies to general branding and verbiage; your customer service strategy must be consistent with your overall company \u201cvoice.\u201d Otherwise, it can be confusing for your customers and they may look elsewhere for their next vehicle.<\/p>\n<p>At TeleDirect, our business process outsourcing (BPO) agents operate as an extension of your business. They study your branding and business values, work with scripts using your verbiage and always strive to keep your image consistent across all platforms.<\/p>\n<h2>Understand Your Customers and Leads<\/h2>\n<p>If you understand your customers and leads, you will be able to better provide great customer service. This, of course, leads to a better overall reputation, more sales and a bigger bottom line!<\/p>\n<p>The best way to know your customers is by doing your research and paying attention to their customer support experiences so far. Many BPO call center services (like TeleDirect) offer dedicated customer satisfaction and feedback surveys, so you can track exactly how your contact center is performing. If any areas are lacking, you\u2019ll be able to develop targeted strategies to get back on track and satisfy your clients and leads.<\/p>\n<h2>Drive Into Success\u2014Let\u2019s Get Started Today!<\/h2>\n<p>At TeleDirect, we offer everything your car dealership needs to succeed\u2014and we also support other auto businesses, like rental centers and manufacturers.

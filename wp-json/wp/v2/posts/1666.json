Not anymore. Here is a brief guide for call center inbound strategies.<\/p>\n<h2>A Brief Guide for an Effective Inbound Call Strategy<\/h2>\n<p>Is your phone ringing off the hook? That\u2019s a good thing\u2014as long as your call center inbound game is on point. When business is booming, and you have a high influx of calls, you can make the most of that wave by offering efficient, helpful customer service to every caller. This will help ensure that your customers and leads have the best possible experience, leading to even more success in the future.<\/p>\n<p>Not sure if your current inbound call strategy is working? That\u2019s where we come in. At TeleDirect, we\u2019ve been helping companies optimize their customer service inbound calls for over 20 years.<\/p>\n<h2>What is an Inbound Call Center?<\/h2>\n<p>An inbound call center is an inclusive service that handles a company\u2019s incoming calls and other customer inquiries, like emails and social media DMs. Inbound call centers do not handle outbound services like cold calls, follow-ups, reminders or fundraising. However, most contact centers offer both services, and many companies incorporate a combination of inbound and outbound services into their customer support platform.<\/p>\n<p>Some companies run their own internal inbound call center, but many work with an outsourced service. There are many perks to this method. BPO call centers tend to work as an extension of your business; they learn your business practices, values and branding to help streamline your communication without any extra strain on your internal team. These companies also have years of applied experience in the customer service industry. In addition, they will have professional inbound agents who speak multiple languages, understand the nuance of conversation and are available around the clock.<\/p>\n<h2>What is an Example of Inbound (and Outbound) Calls?<\/h2>\n<p><strong>Inbound calls<\/strong> come in all shapes, sizes and forms\u2014and your call center team can take care of every type of call. Some examples of typical inbound calls include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h3>Appointment Setting<\/h3>\n<p>If your services require bookings, your customers will want a phone number to make appointments. An inbound call center will be able to manage these incoming requests effortlessly.<\/li>\n<li>\n<h3>Expression of Interest<\/h3>\n<p>You may have leads requiring a quote. On the other hand, maybe your phone is ringing with potential customers who have questions ahead of investing in your product. Either way, your leads are trying to contact you. Are you ready to take their inbound calls?<\/li>\n<li>\n<h3>Troubleshooting<\/h3>\n<p>Occasionally, customers might run into an issue using your product. In those cases, they might call for support. After all, they need a helpful place to direct their questions and need someone to troubleshoot the issue.<\/li>\n<li>\n<h3>Customer Feedback<\/h3>\n<p>When your customers have a memorable experience with your product, your inbound call center should be prepared to hear them. It\u2019s the best way to improve your business.<\/li>\n<li>\n<h3>Queries About Your Product or Service<\/h3>\n<p>Your customers will make inbound queries for all types of reasons: perhaps they want to know when your storefront opens for the day or are curious about the ingredients in your natural wine. Whatever their questions, you need a team who can answer them efficiently.<\/li>\n<li>\n<h3>Interest From Potential Employees<\/h3>\n<p>Are you looking for a new addition to your team? Many potential employees will submit applications, but some might want to work with you badly enough to call you.<\/li>\n<li>\n<h3>Emergency Response<\/h3>\n<p>Depending on your industry, your customers might contact your team in a crisis. In these cases, an automated or internet booking service won\u2019t do\u2014only a call to a helpful person can address their issue.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Business-adjacent outbound calls<\/strong> also cover a wide range of reasons and topics. Some examples of these services include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h3>Callbacks<\/h3>\n<p>Some call centers offer callbacks, so customers don\u2019t need to wait on hold while a resolution is underway. This removes stress and pressure from your team while they work toward a resolution and avoid wasting your clients\u2019 time. This can create a better overall customer service experience.<\/li>\n<li>\n<h3>Cold Calls and Pitching<\/h3>\n<p>When your business contacts a lead to pitch your services, that is an outbound call. When that call is not made in response to previously indicated interest from the lead, it is known as a cold call. Outbound call centers can take care of this for your team. It\u2019s a tricky business and they have years of experience under their belts. BPO services like TeleDirect work with your business to create a customized script, so every cold call is on brand.<\/li>\n<li>\n<h3>Lead Response Management<\/h3>\n<p>When your team reaches out to leads and goes through the conversion process, it is typically done through outbound communication. This includes qualifying and verifying leads before going in for a sale.<\/li>\n<li>\n<h3>Fundraising<\/h3>\n<p>Fundraising efforts tend to be done through outbound call services\u2014though inbound teams are always thrilled with an unsolicited donation. All fundraising scripts are developed with your team, so it\u2019s always on-brand.<\/li>\n<li>\n<h3>Case Resolution<\/h3>\n<p>If your team is working on a complex case, your outbound crew could follow up with customers and provide a resolution. This allows your team to properly handle the issue on their time and contact your client only when a resolution is available.<\/li>\n<li>\n<h3>Appointment Reminders<\/h3>\n<p>Many call center services include outbound appointment reminders so everybody shows up in the right place at the right time.<\/li>\n<li>\n<h3>Results and Feedback<\/h3>\n<p>Many companies utilize outbound feedback services to understand how their customers\u2019 experience has been and to implement any necessary changes resulting from that feedback.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>How to Hire a Great Inbound Call Agent<\/h2>\n<p>Are you looking for a contact center that offers excellent customer service, inbound calls, outbound options and 24\/7 coverage?

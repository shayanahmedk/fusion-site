While most firms lack the internal resources to effectively implement and manage a customer contact center, today\u2019s business process outsourcing (BPO) solutions \u2013 including TeleDirect\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.teledirect.com\/services\/call-center-platform\/\">highly flexible, affordable call center platform<\/a> \u2013 provide exceptional performance across a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.teledirect.com\/industries\/\">wide variety of industries<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>With a powerful contact center in place, businesses can:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Handle customer contact initiatives<\/strong>. From peak volume to regular day-to-day activities, inbound communication is important \u2013 and TeleDirect\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.teledirect.com\/services\/inbound-2\/\">inbound services<\/a> rank second to none!<\/li>\n<li><strong>Market products and services.<\/strong>\u00a0Even as an outsourced contact center takes care of regular communication protocols, an effective <a href=\"https:\/\/www.teledirect.com\/services\/outbound\/\">outbound solution<\/a> grows your business with proven, targeted outreach strategies, including <a href=\"https:\/\/www.teledirect.com\/services\/lead-response-management\/\">lead response management<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Stay updated with reservations &amp; more<\/strong>. Automated services are great for regular <a href=\"https:\/\/www.teledirect.com\/services\/inbound-2\/reservation-services\/\">scheduling and reservations<\/a>, and TeleDirect\u2019s contact center is up to the task!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>But don\u2019t take our word for it; we recently conducted extensive interviews with businesses who\u2019ve experienced optimal results with call center services and more. Here are a few of the responses.<\/p>\n<p>For some businesses, like Home Pro Inspections, the right call center simultaneously scales business growth, even while handling multi-channel communication. Wally Conway, President of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gohomepro.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Home Pro Inspections<\/a>, enjoys the flexibility of growing his bottom line without additional expenses.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cShifting to a call center has forced us to be sure that our process is\u00a0complete, correct and consistent to ensure that the call center can perform\u00a0at the same level as our in house staff,\u201d said Mr. Conway. \u201cThis process has made us better!\u201d<\/p>\n<p>With outsourced call center services, Home Pro Inspections is able to expand at a desired pace without some of the risks that typically accompany steady growth, including unexpected costs and overhead.<\/p>\n<p>Sometimes, it takes an outsourced call center to realize full business potential. That\u2019s certainly the case for <a href=\"https:\/\/aegisfinserv.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AegisFS<\/a>, a global financial consultation company. AegisFS President Jim Angleton likes the idea of implementing an international strategy for his products and services \u2013 and his outsourced call center delivers every time. With consistent growth in the US, European, and Latin American markets, his company is able to meet and exceed projected business expansion.<\/p>\n<p>While some smaller companies frown on the idea of outsourcing call center activities, Mr. Angleton endorses a flexible, robust outsourced call center. \u201cCall centers are worth utilizing and should become a fixed budgeted market and customer support feature,\u201d commented Mr. Angleton. \u201cYou are not too small to engage in call centers.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Keeon Yazdani of <a href=\"https:\/\/cbdrustore.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CBD\u2019R<\/a>, an online drug store specializing in CBD products, echoes the growth factor with call centers. \u201cSince we&#8217;ve begun working with the call center, we&#8217;ve gained an additional 2-3 wholesale customers per day. The key to our success has been keeping the telemarketers motivated by offering commissions for their sales,\u201d said Mr. Yazdani.<\/p>\n<p>While growth is certainly an important element of call center assistance, other businesses focus on direct, professional communication services. Jeff Arnett of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.arnettcredentials.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Arnett Credentials<\/a> likes the idea of limiting constant calls and focusing on other pressing needs. \u201cWith a call center,\u00a0you can\u00a0minimize workplace distractions and get callers speaking with the correct\u00a0person more efficiently.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Streamlined customer communication is critical for companies like Arnett Credentials, where employees take on different roles on a daily basis. Thanks to concise communication from inbound and outbound perspectives, the firm is able to handle increasing customer demand without letting a surge of incoming calls distract from exceptional customer service.<\/p>\n<p>In online banking, customer service is everything. That\u2019s why the team at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.allegrofinance.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Allegro, LLC<\/a> uses call centers. \u201cWe want to be seen as an organization that dedicates making our services simple &amp; easy to follow &#8211; including calling for help. Therefore, we can garner a large and loyal audience since good customer service goes a long way.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Similarly, the team at <a href=\"https:\/\/rapidvisa.com\/?utm_source=kmsig&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=01\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Rapid Visa<\/a> requires timely, supportive customer service.

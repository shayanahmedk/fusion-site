And that socialization is more important than you might think.<\/p>\n<p>In so-called \u201cnormal times,\u201d when stress levels are already somewhat high, relationships promote a sense of community and strengthen ties between family and friends.<\/p>\n<p>2020, in case you haven\u2019t heard, isn\u2019t normal by any means. A year of forgettable events has been punctuated by the COVID-19 outbreak, and with it the subsequent lockdowns, skyrocketing depression, and complete disruption of the good old days. 2019 seems like a long time ago.<\/p>\n<p>Numerous studies illustrate the importance of relationships and social support. People who don\u2019t have ideal support are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2921311\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">prone to poor psychological and physical health<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>But what makes relationships even more critical for health and well-being, particularly during a global pandemic, is the tangible \u201cresilience factor\u201d promoted by a sense of belonging. Relationships actually make humans more resistant to viruses, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC7345443\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">as evidenced by recent COVID-19 research<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>On a personal level, strong relationships are absolutely essential in keeping a positive mindset, even when it seems like all hope is lost.<\/p>\n<p>Likewise for the business world. Think about it \u2013 a typical day of commerce (for any industry, all across the globe) involves literally thousands of people, multi-channel communication methods, and countless cues, suggestions, promises, commitments to customer service, and more.<\/p>\n<p>In other words, relationships are EVERYTHING in business. Relationships are the foundation of commerce, the rock-solid framework that holds together client-business trust, regardless of your particular field.

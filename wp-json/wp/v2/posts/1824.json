Without excellent customer service, you can\u2019t expect to go very far. After all, when customers don\u2019t feel heard or respected, they\u2019ll take their business elsewhere. As business owners, you know this must be avoided at all costs\u2014but developing an excellent customer service strategy can be challenging. That\u2019s where experts can help.<\/p>\n<p>Most successful businesses choose to outsource their customer service platform. This guarantees better support for their clients and leads and helps their internal team perform better and more efficiently. However, many businesses struggle to choose a call center service. A significant part of this decision is hiring <a href=\"https:\/\/www.teledirect.com\/services\/american-call-center-services\/\">U.S.-based call centers<\/a> or internationally-run ones.<\/p>\n<p>If you are unsure whether you would prefer to work with a U.S.-based call center or an internationally run one, read on to learn some of the pros and cons of both options. If you have any specific questions, don\u2019t hesitate to contact our expert team at (208) 999-1111.<\/p>\n<h2>U.S.-Based BPO Companies<\/h2>\n<p>U.S.-based BPO companies like TeleDirect operate solely within the United States. This means that all of their agents are U.S.-based, fluent in English and reachable via a U.S.-based (typically toll-free) number. However, many call centers can still receive calls from international clients.<\/p>\n<p>Curious about the pros and cons of working with an American call center service? Check out our handy list.<\/p>\n<h3>Advantages of U.S. Call Centers<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Local Accessibility<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Sometimes, it\u2019s just easier for customer service reps to be in the same state or country as the clients they are helping. Not only will agents be able to escalate calls to local services if necessary, they can also use contextual, geographical knowledge to solve issues quicker. Everyone will be in the same (or similar) time zone, creating a more cohesive experience.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cultural Compatibility<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Nuance can be critical in customer service\u2014and language matters. That\u2019s why a local call center is crucial to a successful business. Your agents will be on the same cultural wavelength as your customers, making them less likely to cause accidental offense through word choice.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Data Security<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We love to travel. But we\u2019d much prefer to stay put when it comes to data. Local call center representation means your data information doesn\u2019t need to cross international waters. You will also have better access to local support and authorities in the unlikely case of any breach.<\/p>\n<h3>Challenges of U.S. Call Centers<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Cost<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>American call center companies are some of the finest in the world, but quality comes with a price tag. However, while U.S.-based <a href=\"https:\/\/www.teledirect.com\/services\/call-center-platform\/\">call center platforms<\/a> might be a bigger investment, that\u2019s because they are worth every dime. Not only do they cover all eventualities, but they can also be entirely customized to your unique business needs. At TeleDirect, we also offer scalable options that work across various price points so that more brands can grow with us.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Availability of Qualified Personnel<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Some parts of the world are renowned for having great customer service platforms. These countries tend to have stellar <a href=\"https:\/\/www.teledirect.com\/services\/inbound\/\">inbound <\/a>and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.teledirect.com\/services\/outbound\/\">outbound live agents<\/a> trained for years in their craft.<\/p>\n<p>While the United States does not have such a reputation, there are certain companies whose agents adhere to the high standards across the world of telemarketing. We are one of them; our agents are true pros.<\/p>\n<h2>International BPO Companies<\/h2>\n<h3>Advantages of International Call Centers<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Lower Costs<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Due to differing exchange rates and economies worldwide, international BPO companies can sometimes be a more affordable option for American companies to invest in.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Increased Flexibility<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>By working with a call center in another part of the world, you will have agents in different time zones and, therefore, will be able to offer more coverage around the clock. However, many American call center companies (like TeleDirect) also offer 24\/7 coverage within the United States.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Improved Language Skills<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The U.S. is a melting pot of cultures and languages. That\u2019s why having an internationally run call center can be advantageous\u2014your callers can receive support in their native language. However, plenty of U.S.-based call centers have this same advantage. At TeleDirect, we ensure that our agents are multilingual to help more clients.<\/p>\n<h3>Challenges of International Call Centers<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Cultural Differences<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Minor cultural differences can sometimes lead to misunderstandings, which can have a more significant impact than intended over the phone. It can be helpful for your callers and agents to have the same cultural touchpoints.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Distance<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Sometimes, it can be challenging for a customer to be physically removed from the agent supporting them. It can hinder case resolution, as sometimes it\u2019s required to contact local services for additional support.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Data Privacy Concerns<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>As we mentioned before, the less distance your data needs to travel, the better. International call centers may be more affordable and flexible, but you might have an increased chance of your customer\u2019s personal information being leaked.<\/p>\n<h2>How to Decide Between U.S. and International Call Centers<\/h2>\n<p>Ultimately, the choice is yours.

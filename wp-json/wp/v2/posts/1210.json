You might be surprised to learn that many of our valued customers <a href=\"https:\/\/www.teledirect.com\/#contact-form\">initially contact TeleDirect<\/a> with only a vague idea of each type of client communication.<\/p>\n<p>Which one should your business concentrate on? It depends on a multitude of factors:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Business or service type<\/strong>. Every enterprise has its own unique call center demands. Marketing agencies typically concentrate on outbound calls due to marketing opportunities. Hospitals and healthcare centers, meanwhile, are more oriented toward inbound calls, due to critical patient communication, appointment follow-up communication, and other incoming communication.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Industry Considerations<\/strong>. Depending on the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.teledirect.com\/industries\/\">current business climate and your industry<\/a>, your business may have to shift from inbound to outbound communication, and vice versa. The ability to recognize quickly changing circumstances, and adjust accordingly, is one advantage TeleDirect\u2019s business process outsourcing (BPO) call center services provides.<\/li>\n<li><strong>\u201cNeed it now,\u201d on-demand call center support<\/strong>. From product recalls to other crisis communication, inbound and outbound solutions can vary in importance literally from day to day, even hour to hour. Again, on-the-fly tweaks to your call center are streamlined with TeleDirect\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.teledirect.com\/services\/inbound\/\">inbound<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.teledirect.com\/services\/outbound\/\">outbound<\/a> call services.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Knowing the differences between the two main types of customer communication protocols helps any business owner, CEO, non-profit executive or enterprise leader effectively recognize, analyze, and plan their call centers to handle clients and customers.<\/p>\n<p>From our perspective, both inbound and outbound services are critical. But they ebb and flow in terms of critical functions and relevance. Let\u2019s see how each service differs, and how you can leverage this information to improve your customer communication platform.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Main Differences Between Inbound and Outbound Solutions<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>So what are the main differences between inbound and outbound call centers? The main distinction is the call direction. <strong>Inbound call centers<\/strong> focus on receiving client\/customer calls. This inbound communication could be for service assistance, support, appointment confirmations, and other related calls. Thus, an effective inbound solution typically requires intuitive automated support or professional, customer-focused agents who can quickly offer assistance. Many times, both automated and live agent help is required for inbound solutions. Comprehensive customer service is imperative for effective inbound call centers.<\/p>\n<p>What about <strong>outbound call centers<\/strong>? Think of outbound solutions as the polar opposite of the inbound variety. While inbound systems are centered on customer service and real-time assistance, outbound call centers are all about marketing. Sales techniques, lead response management, and other marketing initiatives comprise outbound communication.<\/p>\n<p>Another important difference between inbound and outbound solutions involves the clients. Most inbound communication is from <strong>existing customers<\/strong>, while the majority of outbound calls are for <strong>potential customers<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Tipping Point: The 50% Rule<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>As a general rule of thumb, and call center that takes 50% or more of calls from customers is technically an inbound system. Conversely, a contact platform that places more than half their calls to customers (as outreach, marketing, etc.) is an outbound center.<\/p>\n<p>Some businesses are firmly entrenched one way or the other. Others ride a fine line between inbound and outbound solutions. Thankfully, with TeleDirect\u2019s call center platform, our clients can pick and choose which services they need at any given time.

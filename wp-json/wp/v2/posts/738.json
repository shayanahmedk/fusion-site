Sometimes, an unorthodox approach is desired \u2013 even necessary. The present state of virtual communications \u2013 building trust and ensuring satisfaction without actual face-to-face meetings \u2013 provides plenty of challenges, but three different companies (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.teledirect.com\/\">TeleDirect<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.messagingservice.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Access Direct<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/globafone.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Globafone<\/a>) have managed to thrive in this ever-perilous environment.<\/p>\n<p>Smitha Baliga (CEO of TeleDirect), John Kinskey (President &amp; Founder of Access Direct) and Louis Altman (Founder &amp; CEOI of Globafone) recently spoke about building relationships with customers, delivering top-notch customer service and the keys to making virtual communications work.<\/p>\n<h2>How important is customer service?<\/h2>\n<p>Smitha Baliga, CEO of TeleDirect, believes that good customer service isn\u2019t just important, it\u2019s vital. According to Ms. Baliga, \u201cIrrespective of the size of your business, good customer service needs to be at the heart of your business model if you wish to be successful. Good customer service leads to customer satisfaction which can generate positive word-of-mouth for your business and help your business grow and prosper. Customers are willing to pay more for a better experience. It reflects heavily on your entire business and is a great marketing tool.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>TeleDirect also stresses the \u201cThe Moment of Truth,\u201d the critical and definitive moment when their client\u2019s customers engage with their call center personnel for the first time. You never get a second chance to make a first impression, as the saying goes, and TeleDirect uses this urgency to improve their customer service model.<\/p>\n<p><strong>John Kinskey<\/strong>, President and Founder of Access Direct, uses customer service to distinguish his company\u2019s services from industry competitors. According to Mr. Kinskey, \u201cI have always felt that our customer service sets us apart from the other companies in our field. Many large companies offering virtual phone systems for small businesses do so with a hands-off approach, expecting all small business owners to be fluent in the technical side of the business as well as running the business itself. This hands-off approach may work for a large company with a dedicated IT staff, but for a one-to-five-person business, it can be a very high bar to clear.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>A dedicated support team is also crucial for Access Direct\u2019s success. With a dedicated support team, the company provides value and shows commitment to their client\u2019s success. Plus, this \u201cgo the extra mile\u201d mentality also reduces the initial pressure of learning a new system. For a busy client, that type of service is hard to put a price tag on.<\/p>\n<p>For some executives, customer service is everything. \u201cIt is our lifeblood,\u201d said <strong>Louis Altman<\/strong>, Founder &amp; CEOI of Globafone. \u201cIf you are selling the same exact product as every competitor, you need to do something different and better and special\u201d<\/p>\n<p>From Mr. Altman\u2019s perspective, price-cutting only goes so far, due to the product similarity within the telecommunication industry. That\u2019s where superior customer service comes into play. \u201cIf your customers know you stand behind what you sell, they are willing to pay a little more,\u201d said Mr. Altman.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Customer service and remote communication: delivering when you\u2019re <u>not<\/u> up close and personal.<\/h2>\n<p>Providing your clients and customers value \u2013 even when you\u2019re not directly across the table \u2013 provides daily challenges to the telecommunication industry. How do business leaders bridge the gap?<\/p>\n<p>Mr. Kinskey believes timing is crucial \u201cPrompt response time is key. When you don\u2019t have the customer in front of you, it\u2019s important to reply to their concerns quickly and efficiently,\u201d explained Mr. Kinskey. In other words, don\u2019t let the distance scare you. It\u2019s the time that should concern you. According to Mr. Kinskey, time is a huge trust-builder when client communication isn\u2019t face-to-face.<\/p>\n<p>Ms. Baliga believes that when communications aren\u2019t face-to-face, words and tone carry all the weight. \u201cWe have our call center representatives be cheerful and polite when they talk. \u00a0Smiling when you talk on the phone helps your voice to sound friendly, warm and receptive. TeleDirect believes in prompt and effective communication with our clients. Our client support team is in constant touch with our clients and they work on providing timely and effective solutions,\u201d said Ms. Baliga.<\/p>\n<p>And don\u2019t forget the importance of educating your customers. Globafone\u2019s hallmark customer service includes education. \u201cWe want our clients to understand the nuances of the industry so they can make the best choice when it is time.\u00a0 Free education is a HUGE differentiator as is keeping the client\u2019s goals in mind. Customers who aren\u2019t directly across the table benefit from learning about the industry they\u2019re in,\u201d said Mr. Altman. To help bolster Globafone\u2019s educational tools, they\u2019ve developed learning modules and other educational resources to help solidify trust and set the foundation for a long-term business relationship.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Building successful relationships with customers.<\/h2>\n<p>Mr. Altman\u2019s stresses a simple, straightforward approach, along with an open mind about his customers\u2019 concerns. \u201cFocus on their goals and find the solution that solves the problem. Listen, acknowledge, and always offer help,\u201d Mr. Altman said. For Globafone, this also involves utilizing their considerable educational resources. The company makes an effort to enhance the educational process, which complements their new products and services. Customer loyalty should also be recognized and rewarded. \u201cWhen there is a better deal, give it to them.\u00a0 The longer a client stays, the better deal they get,\u201d concluded Mr. Altman.<\/p>\n<p>In order to build a strong relationship with your customer, you need to know your customer \u2013 which involves listening. \u201cHonestly, it\u2019s as easy as that,\u201d said Mr. Kinskey. \u201cListen to their concerns; really hear what they are saying; and absorb that knowledge and refer to it during interactions with that customer. An effective solution to customer concerns starts with an attentive ear.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cTrust, integrity and commitment are essential ingredients for successful long-term relationships.

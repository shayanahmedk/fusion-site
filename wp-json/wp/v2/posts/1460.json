By outsourcing certain facets of your business to dedicated and skilled professionals, your business will enjoy a more organized and streamlined performance, leading to happier customers, a better work-life balance and an improved reputation across your industry and client base.<\/p>\n<p>While BPO has been around for a long time, it\u2019s a field that\u2019s always adapting. After all, the world of business has an ever-changing nature, and that\u2019s reflected by whichever business process outsourcing trends emerge over time.<\/p>\n<p>2022 is a unique year, both in terms of business and global affairs. Business process outsourcing trends confirm that as society naviages the long-term effects of major events like Covid-19, it\u2019s made a difference to the way companies operate, what customers expect from their services and the forms of technology available to brands. This has led to exciting new BPO industry trends.<\/p>\n<p>At TeleDirect, our fingers are always at the pulse of the BPO industry, especially when it comes to call center outsourcing trends! Here, we\u2019ve compiled some of what we consider to be the biggest and most exciting emerging trends in the BPO industry. You can also contact us at (800) 776-1081 for more information on how we can use BPO market trends to help YOUR business grow.<\/p>\n<h2>What is BPO?<\/h2>\n<p>BPO refers to the collaboration that takes place between a company and a third-party organization that they\u2019ve hired to perform specific tasks or facets of their operation. BPO services span across all types of industries. Whether your company needs expert help in payroll and billing, PR and advertisement or technical customer support, BPO is your answer.<\/p>\n<h2>The Top BPO Industry Trends 2022<\/h2>\n<p>This year, plenty of exciting BPO trends have popped up across the business world. We expect that the following ones will remain relevant throughout the decade ahead.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h3>Dedicated Call Centers by Industry<\/h3>\n<p>In this day and age, people expect convenience, flexibility and constant availability when investing in a product or service. This translates to hundreds of scenarios: customers expect the ability to book a flight at midnight, troubleshoot a dysfunctioning product after business hours or dispute a fraudulent payment on a Sunday. This is where call center outsourcing comes in.<br \/>\nYou can\u2019t expect your team to be on-call 24\/7; instead, let a dedicated call center service take on that responsibility. A good company (like TeleDirect) has dedicated services for all sorts of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.teledirect.com\/industries\/\">industries<\/a>, and will work with your team to create a customized contact center your clients can depend on.<\/li>\n<li>\n<h3>Cloud Technology<\/h3>\n<p>Cloud tech has been around for years, but in 2022, the market for it has skyrocketed, thanks to the continued popularity of paperless business and remote work\u2013it\u2019s a notable emerging trend in the BPO industry. With cloud technology, everything from file-sharing to storage is streamlined, accessible and more user-friendly than ever before.<br \/>\nCloud tech is also great news for companies that outsource facets of their business\u2014when file storage and sharing is so seamless, it\u2019s easier to keep your third-party teams fully equipped to perform every necessary task.<\/li>\n<li>\n<h3>Widened Horizons<\/h3>\n<p>One of our favorite emerging trends in BPO is thanks to rising popularity of remote work. This trend really began back during the early days of the pandemic, but we\u2019re glad it\u2019s sticking around. While in the 2010s, BPO services were often local providers who met businesses in person, we\u2019re taking a different approach in 2022.<br \/>\nAs the lockdowns demonstrated, great business can be conducted from anywhere. Now, companies are reaching beyond their own backyards and investing in companies across the country (and even the globe) to find a third-party service provider that best suits their needs.<\/li>\n<li>\n<h3>Customized Services<\/h3>\n<p>Whether you want live call center agents who follow specific scripts or need help navigating specific apps related to your industry, you\u2019re in luck. In 2022, customized services are an increasingly common choice among BPO providers. After all, one size does not fit all!<\/li>\n<li>\n<h3>Integration of AI<\/h3>\n<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) isn\u2019t just a trend\u2014it\u2019s the only way forward. These days, it\u2019s impossible to see a business model without some implantation of AI\u2014and that translates to the BPO industry. In 2022, BPO providers utilize AI for a number of services, like data entry. We expect that trend is here to not only stay, but grow.<\/li>\n<li>\n<h3>Airtight Cybersecurity<\/h3>\n<p>Not all companies are created the same. In 2022, we know much more about the importance of security, particularly cybersecurity. Now, we\u2019re well aware of how easily data breaches can happen and just how much havoc they can wreak. This is why one of the most important BPO industry trends of 2022 is to take cybersecurity seriously.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Get to Know More About Emerging Trends in BPO!<\/h2>\n<p>At TeleDirect, we\u2019ve been offering call center BPO services to industries across America for over 20 years.

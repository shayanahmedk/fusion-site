T<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/04\/10\/salesforce-and-google-want-to-build-a-smarter-customer-service-experience\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"s2\">aking Salesforce\u2019s considerable acquired knowledge and Google\u2019s powerful AI enterprise<\/span><\/a>, representative were able to show how AI can make the human experience for customers more reliable, timely, and ultimately satisfying.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Since that 2017 collaboration, it looks increasingly likely that AI chatbots aren\u2019t quite ready to grab the customer service torch. Rather, AI is the perfect complementary element for effective, streamlined human interaction.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Why will AI enhance, not replace, professional live agents?<\/span><\/p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Costs<\/b>. As much as conventional wisdom has you believe that it\u2019s inefficient to have an all-human customer service staff, the costs (salary, benefits, you name it) usually pale in comparison to a full-blown, AI-driven, automated call center platform. And that\u2019s one great thing about TeleDirect \u2013 with our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.teledirect.com\/value-results\/\"><span class=\"s2\">value and results-based approach<\/span><\/a> to call centers and other BPO services, every client can customize exactly how much automation they\u2019d like to implement!<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>People prefer people.<\/b> Breaking news: most people who call a customer service line are disappointed with an AI-intensive, automated platform. There\u2019s nothing quite like an actual human on the other end of the line to address their concerns!<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Lagging technology<\/b>. AI is constantly touted as the next big thing in streamlined customer service. And while certain elements (chatbots and analytics, for example) are certainly impressive, the technology isn\u2019t up to speed yet. Case in point: real human interaction (see above) requires a real human response to fully inform AND empathize. Think that fancy AI system knows all the sophisticated inflections, pauses, and slang of genuine person-to-person interaction? Think again.<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Blended is better<\/b>. Since the dawn of the call center \u2013 particularly traditional <a href=\"https:\/\/www.teledirect.com\/services\/inbound\/\"><span class=\"s2\">inbound activities<\/span><\/a> \u2013 the live agent has been the star of the show. Humans aren\u2019t going away from essential customer service duties. But with a vast database and SOME automated responses for certain questions, a perfect combination of live agents and AI-based interaction is emerging as the optimal way to handle customer requests and questions.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Get in Touch with TeleDirect Today: Enjoy Full-Service Live Agents, Professional Outsourcing &amp; More!<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Clearly, humans are sticking around.

If customers wanted to buy a product or service, they had to get to the place of business during open hours or go without. Even if they ordered by phone, they still had to call during the company\u2019s prescribed hours of operation, which were usually set up for the convenience of the business rather than the customer. In a way, business was limited to geographical and time constraints.<\/p>\n<p>These days, not so much.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks to the Internet, social media and increased global competition, today\u2019s consumers decide when and where they will purchase a product or service.

These include:<\/p>\n<h3><b>Superior customer service.<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>There are plenty of advantages of outsourcing customer service. As already mentioned, today\u2019s consumers expect to be able to buy products and services at any hour of the day or night. They also expect to receive help when they need it. Whether it\u2019s returning a product, seeking technical support, resolving problems with billing, or simply seeking information about a product or service, they want to do it on <i>their<\/i> schedule, not yours.<\/p>\n<p>Bad customer service drives away clients and diminishes your brand. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.teledirect.com\/services\/inbound\/customer-service\/\">Superior customer service<\/a> sets you apart from the competition and increases client retention. With a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.teledirect.com\/services\/24-7-call-center-services\/\">24\/7 call center<\/a> trained in the nuances of your products, services and business model, you can deliver an exemplary customer service experience every time, all while focusing on what you do best &#8211; provide products and services to\u00a0 your customers. Let TeleDirect handle your call center tasks, and see the advantages of outsourcing customer service!<\/p>\n<p>Just some of the numerous benefits of outsourcing call center services with TeleDirect include:<\/p>\n<h3><b>Increased sales results.<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>The \u201cinstant gratification\u201d mentality of today\u2019s consumers applies to sales as well as customer service. Suppose someone decides they must have your product at 10:00 p.m. or in another time zone halfway around the world. If you\u2019re not open for business, that prospective customer will find a competitor that is. Many surveys show that 9 in 10 customers won\u2019t leave a voicemail when considering purchases. With a 24\/7 call center, queued customers are more likely to become paying customers!<\/p>\n<p>Equally important, a 24-hour answering service gives you round-the-clock access to your customers. Engaging directly with customers is the most effective way to increase sales. With a 24\/7 call center, you can generate more leads and close more sales through personalized interaction with your target market.<\/p>\n<h3><b>Live operators make the difference.<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>Today\u2019s consumers hate automated phone systems and voice mail.

In this article, you&#8217;ll learn effective strategies for cold calling and outbound calling to attract new customers to your business.<\/p>\n<h2>Cold Calling vs. Outbound Calling<\/h2>\n<p>Are you wondering about the difference between cold calling and outbound calling? While the two are similar and have some overlap, there are a few key differences. Today, we will review the two types of calling and provide tips for optimizing them within your call center.<\/p>\n<h2>What Is an Outbound Call?<\/h2>\n<p>In the customer service world, this is when a consumer or business receives an incoming call from a company or brand. Outbound calls are made for many reasons: to pitch a service or product, for fundraising purposes, to make or remind customers of bookings, to follow up on a previous conversation or even to ask for post-purchase feedback. Not all outbound calls are categorized as cold calls; however, all cold calls are a form of outbound calling.<\/p>\n<h2>What Is a Cold Call?<\/h2>\n<p>A cold call refers to an \u201cunsolicited\u201d phone call made by a business to a potential customer. This includes referrals given to you by another brand or customer. The term applies to any potential consumer who has yet to explicitly express interest in or reach out in any way to your brand. Cold calling can lead to new partnerships, bigger sales and more diverse business\u2014but they need to be done correctly. Otherwise, they can be viewed as a nuisance.<\/p>\n<h2>What Is an Outbound Caller,\u00a0 and What Do They Do?<\/h2>\n<p>An outbound caller, or an outbound agent, is a type of customer service representative. Typically, they work from a call center. Unlike inbound agents, they don\u2019t take any phone calls\u2014they only make them. An outbound caller will perform any outgoing phone communication. This might include services like appointment reminders, delivery of test results, lead response management, resolution callbacks and feedback <a href=\"https:\/\/www.jotform.com\/surveys\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">surveys<\/a>. Outbound calling agents can also help businesses make cold sales calls and pitches when necessary.<\/p>\n<h2>How to Cold Call Businesses<\/h2>\n<p>Are you looking for B2B cold call sales techniques? We have several effective cold call strategies in our repertoire\u2014it\u2019s about creating a personal touch. By trying these strategies, you might be able to raise your success <a href=\"https:\/\/www.teledirect.com\/services\/\">rates of cold calling.<\/a><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h3>Do Your Research<\/h3>\n<p>It comes down to respect. Think of it from a personal angle. Let\u2019s imagine you are hoping to meet somebody on a dating app. What would you be more likely to respond to\u2014a copy-paste note that calls you by the wrong name, or a personalized message about your shared interests? Most people would find the latter much more appealing\u2014and may find the former a bit rude. The same principle applies to cold calling. When a business receives a cold call or pitch from somebody who didn\u2019t research their brand, it\u2019s often not well received. After all, why invest time (and money) into working with a company that can\u2019t be bothered to do the same?<\/li>\n<li>\n<h3>Prepare a Script (With Multiple Options)<\/h3>\n<p>With a script, you\u2019ll never slip. Cold calls can go in various directions. Your champion will be a script with several answering options for different conversations. Not only will a detailed script give your outbound callers better tools to handle every situation, but they are also the perfect way to create a cohesive brand experience across all your channels.<\/li>\n<li>\n<h3>Listen and Respond<\/h3>\n<p>Yes, you have a script, but it\u2019s important to stay in the moment and respond naturally. If your cold calls sound like one giant monologue, and your scripted responses are robotic and not always relevant to the questions asked, your pitch isn\u2019t going to be successful. Be sure to listen to what the person on the other end of the phone is saying, and find a response that shows you heard them. This is a conversation, not just a sales pitch.<\/li>\n<li>\n<h3>Put Yourself in Their Shoes<\/h3>\n<p>Let\u2019s say you run a seafood supply company and want to expand your distribution rates by cold calling waterfront restaurants. That\u2019s a great plan! Now, let\u2019s say that your sales team calls every restaurant on your list around noon. Unfortunately, that\u2019s when those restaurants are filling up for lunchtime. They\u2019ll be much too busy to hear your pitch and consider investing in your company, regardless of how freshly caught your fish might be. A small mistake like this could easily cost your company new business. That\u2019s why we always remind businesses to put themselves in a company\u2019s shoes before cold calling them. Consider their needs and what type of pitch could resonate with them\u2014it will make an enormous difference.<\/li>\n<li>\n<h3>Let a B2B Pro Take the Reins<\/h3>\n<p>Not sure how to cold call businesses?

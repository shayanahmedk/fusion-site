Sure, each client is unique, but for focusing on what matters to your customers, it helps to know about these 5 types of customers:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Long-term &amp; loyal customers<\/strong>: They\u2019re the backbone of your business model, the clients who keep coming back because you deliver results. Take your entire client base. Now, figure out which customers comprise half of your sales figures, but less than a quarter of your total client base. Those are the loyal customers.

Also known as impulse buyers, these clients are the toughest to figure out from the 5 types of customers. In their eyes, your product or service is the most important thing in the world right now, at this moment. Figuring out how to convince them your business\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.teledirect.com\/value-results\/\">value and results<\/a> will help turn this customer into a long-term, profitable relationship!<\/li>\n<li><strong>Potential customers<\/strong>.

Some customers require a bit of persuasion to buy your products and services. Others, like this type of customer, have already made up their minds, so you want to make their transaction as painless as possible. Do you have a streamlined <a href=\"https:\/\/www.teledirect.com\/services\/inbound\/order-processing\/\">order processing strategy<\/a>?

But don\u2019t lower your price too much \u2013 this type of customer, at a low enough cost, will think even you don\u2019t believe in your business!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>See How TeleDirect Can Help You With All Types of Customers!<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Regardless of your industry, you only have so much hours in the day.

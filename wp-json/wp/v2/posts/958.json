The CMS Star Ratings help inform beneficiaries about the performance of health and drug plans on the Medicare Plan Finder (MPF) website, help Medicare patients determine which providers are a good fit, optimize beneficiary outcomes, enhance beneficiary experiences, and improve overall healthcare efficiency.<\/p>\n<p>The star rating system was established by the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cms.gov\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services<\/a> (CMS), a division of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).<\/p>\n<p>While the Star Ratings system is intended to quickly improve beneficiaries\u2019 plan choices, it also elevates the entire patient experience across the healthcare continuum. The CMS Star Rating system is beneficial for both patients and care providers. Thanks to this rating system, patients have a better chance to connect with the care (and CMS call center) that aligns with their needs. CMS star ratings adhere to six primary priorities:<\/p>\n<h2><\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Safer care<\/strong>. A CMS rating is an effective tool to promote safer, more responsive care.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Strong relationships<\/strong>. CMS hospital star ratings and CMS rankings ensure that everyone is fully engaged in all aspects of their care.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Better communication.<\/strong> Thanks to a CMS rating, providers and patients can optimize the coordination and communication of care across the entire health continuum \u2013 outpatient therapy, minor procedures, ER care, and much more.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Promotion of preventive care<\/strong>. A higher CMS ranking is designed to show patients the care providers that can help lower mortality rates.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Community-wide awareness<\/strong>. Healthy living requires teamwork, and CMS star ratings are another way to enable healthy lifestyles \u2013 regardless of age!<\/li>\n<li><strong>Affordability<\/strong>. Reducing costs is a big part of an enjoyable healthcare experience. With a CMS ranking to reference, providers can better provide new and improved health care delivery models.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #000000;\">TeleDirect: Your Best Option for Five Star CMS Call Center Ratings<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Thanks to our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.teledirect.com\/services\/call-center-platform\/\">flexible and affordable call center platform<\/a>, your healthcare group can gain a coveted five star CMS rating.

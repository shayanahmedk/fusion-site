What was the difference? One person was probably professional, friendly, courteous and knowledgeable. The other may have left you with unanswered questions, the sour taste of frequent interruptions and more questions than resolutions. We\u2019ve all seen the good, the bad and the ugly as it relates to business phone etiquette.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That\u2019s<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> where a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.teledirect.com\/services\/inbound\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">customer service script<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> comes <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">into play<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Call handling scripts<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> outline the customer&#8217;s journey and prompt the person representing your company to create a memorable and consistent interaction with a client, customer or business associate.

Empathizing with customers requires patience, understanding and active listening. It lets customers know you have their back and develops an authentic connection.

Yes, AI is smart, but lacks the human touch and empathy. Hearing an automated response is far different than personalized service.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another mistake is creating a generalized <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">phone call script<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Nothing irritates a customer more than feeling like they are not being heard and the person at the other end of the phone is simply reading a standardized message. At TeleDirect, we dig deep to determine the most important information to include in your <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">call center script<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

For instance, are most customer calls related to purchases, troubleshooting or making appointments or reservations? Each of these callers requires a different <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">customer service script<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Determine the most common calls and create a <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">business phone script<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> unique to each situation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do you get calls from business associates and investors? While these calls are typically transferred, or the recipient takes a message, that initial greeting and the tone it invokes<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> illustrate <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">your priorities. An upbeat tone of voice may reflect interest and empathy, while a monotone demonstrates disinterest and boredom. The 7-38-55 rule suggests <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">that <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">tone of voice makes up 38% of all communications.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Always keep in mind that a <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">customer service script<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is an outline.

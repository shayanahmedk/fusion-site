A client isn\u2019t completely satisfied with the product they bought. Or, they have a question about a particular service plan. The next logical step is a call to customer service.<\/p>\n<p>Expecting a friendly, knowledgeable agent to address their concerns, they\u2019re instead presented with an automated answering service. So much for personalized attention!<\/p>\n<p>A similar glitch in client communication occurs with chatbots. When inbound client outreach happens with a chat portal, the last thing many customers want to see is the customary, cold boilerplate that basically says, \u201cHi! I\u2019m a robot. A real person isn\u2019t available right now, so I\u2019ll use keywords, algorithms and scientific data analysis to try and figure out your problem. Let\u2019s go!\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Simply put, the so-called \u201crobotic revolution\u201d for inbound customer contact portals isn\u2019t coming anytime soon. Customers definitely prefer an empathetic, intuitive live agent to handle their issues.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.teledirect.com\/\">TeleDirect<\/a> assists with all of your outreach requirements, both automated and live agent support. Our business processing outsourced (BPO) solutions also offer a complete, value-added assortment of business-boosting tools and resources (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.teledirect.com\/services\/inbound\/direct-response\/\">direct response &amp; media support<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.teledirect.com\/services\/inbound\/tier-1-tech-support\/\">help desk assistance<\/a>, etc.) to offer <a href=\"https:\/\/www.teledirect.com\/industries\/\">premium ROI for any industry<\/a> \u2013 including yours!<\/p>\n<p>But back to the question at hand: how close are we, really, to the incoming automated takeover?<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>The Case for Live Agent Support<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s be clear about automated response systems: there\u2019s a time and place for them in many customer contact portals, particularly for large-scale enterprises that require 24\/7\/365 response capability.<\/p>\n<p>As far as cost savings, chatbots \u2013 the so-called \u201crobots\u201d of the call center world \u2013 offer significant savings over traditional agent-associated expenses. For example, many companies can save <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/blogs\/watson\/2017\/10\/how-chatbots-reduce-customer-service-costs-by-30-percent\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">over 25% of their customer service budget<\/a> with strategically deployed chatbot interfaces.<\/p>\n<p>But at what cost to overall customer confidence? For general inquires (hours of operation, discount details, etc.), chatbots and other robotic communication means are perfectly fine. But when the situation demands a real human being to step in and assuage doubt and reassure clients about your products and services, it\u2019s hard to top a live agent.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re looking for a personal, human touch to your customer communication strategy, look no further than TeleDirect.

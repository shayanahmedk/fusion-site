Manufacturing automation. Fast food restaurants. Even call centers. Much like factory workers and burger flippers, call center agents will soon be tossed into the ash-heap of history.<\/p>\n<p>Not so fast.<\/p>\n<p>While it certainly has its place in contact center platforms, artificial intelligence (AI) still has a few downsides. AI to replace call center agents and traditional <a href=\"https:\/\/www.teledirect.com\/services\/call-center-platform\/\">call center platforms<\/a>? Let\u2019s pump the brakes on that notion, at least for now.<\/p>\n<p>While the AI replacing call centers theory has more than a few adherents, the simple truth is that contact center AI technology, for all its chat-bot, tech-heavy features, still lacks basic human empathy \u2013 the one thing that customers &amp; clients simply can\u2019t do without.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.teledirect.com\/\">TeleDirect<\/a>, the leader in business process outsourcing (BPO), realizes the benefits of AI. Our contact center AI software offers on-point analytics, smart sales tools and delivers <a href=\"https:\/\/www.teledirect.com\/value-results\/\">value &amp; results<\/a> across <a href=\"https:\/\/www.teledirect.com\/industries\/\">multiple industries<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>But we also know that live agents are irreplaceable.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Will AI Replace Call Center Agents?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>So if you\u2019re wondering will call center jobs be automated by AI\u2026it\u2019s OK to be concerned. But since customers prefer human interaction \u2013 and in many instances, demand it \u2013 the reports of the impending call center agent demise are, to borrow a phrase from Mark Twain, greatly exaggerated.<\/p>\n<p>Many business analysts tout the cost saving advantages of AI and chatbots. But even as call centers can <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/blogs\/watson\/2017\/10\/how-chatbots-reduce-customer-service-costs-by-30-percent\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">save up to a quarter of expenses<\/a> with contact center AI technology, there\u2019s always a point of diminishing return.<\/p>\n<p>That point directly intersects with the primal human emotion to connect with other people. And during crisis interactions \u2013 from healthcare contact centers to retail product recalls and even power outages \u2013 nearly everyone that calls a contact center wants to talk to someone else. Thus, the process of AI replacing call centers will take longer than expected.<\/p>\n<p>So, will AI replace call center agents? Maybe someday in the distant future. But for now, the optimal outsourced call center solution is a balanced combination of automated applications with live agent expertise.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s exactly what TeleDirect delivers.

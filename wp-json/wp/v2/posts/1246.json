Poor customer service is linked to low satisfaction metrics, disappointed clients, and reduced profits.<\/p>\n<p>Everyone from employment psychologists to corporate-sponsored business coaches seeks a winning strategy to enhance the customer experience. After years of research and adaptations to account for today\u2019s fluid business environment and ways of working, the one key to exceeding client expectations is actually <u>four ways<\/u>.<\/p>\n<p>And fortunately, they\u2019re alliterative and easy to remember. The four E\u2019s of the customer experience are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Expectations<\/li>\n<li>Execution<\/li>\n<li>Efforts<\/li>\n<li>Emotions<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Take care of the four E\u2019s, and your business is likely to receive straight A\u2019s in customer service. How do the four phases apply to your day-to-day client interactions, and how does this theory drive <a href=\"https:\/\/www.teledirect.com\/\">TeleDirect\u2019s<\/a> own exceptionally high standard of customer service?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Analyzing the Four E\u2019s: How to Ensure Happy Customers \u2013 Regardless of Your Industry<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>TeleDirect\u2019s business process outsourcing (BPO) services demand a flexible, practical way to implement a variety of customer communication tools. We work with large enterprises, small startups, and other firms across the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.teledirect.com\/industries\/\">entire industrial continuum<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>On the surface, the business objectives of an insurance company appear drastically different to a healthcare firm. However, their goals intersect and overlap with the desire to obtain and retain clients.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s the blueprint for our BPO call center services, sales resources, inbound &amp; outbound solutions, and more. Those formidable yet fundamental building blocks of customer service \u2013 the four E\u2019s \u2013 define our customer service objectives\u2026and in many ways, can bolster your own client satisfaction along the way!<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s how each element applies and influences overall customer satisfaction:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Expectations<\/strong>. Our customers come to TeleDirect to solve real-life business problems. And you\u2019re doing the same with your business or service. On a certain level, you\u2019re solving a problem for your customers, and it all starts with expectations. Deliver quality each and every time, and your customer\u2019s own expectations change for the better. That means you\u2019re raising the bar for future expectations, and that\u2019s how long-term, profitable business relationships are established and maintained.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Emotions<\/strong>. You can\u2019t have expectations without emotions; after all, your customers initially reached out to you partly based on emotion, in order to fulfill their expectations. For many clients, frustration (one of the strongest emotions) with their current business processes (or lack of processes) drove them to try your products or services. Understand the emotional process behind customer service, and you\u2019re better able to deliver an exceptional (and emotionally positive) client experience! To cite just one example, TeleDirect\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.teledirect.com\/services\/inbound\/\">highly trained call center agents<\/a> provide genuine emotion (and human empathy, which many contact centers lack) with professional, personalized attention to detail. Is your business doing the same thing? If not, look for ways to tilt the \u201cemotional quotient\u201d in your favor.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Efforts<\/strong>. Are you making a tangible effort to boost customer service? More importantly, do your clients know that your effort is working on their behalf? When customer service fails to deliver \u2013 a timely response, a satisfactory follow-up, a superior product \u2013 too often, customers think they have to make a greater effort, because you\u2019re not doing the work on your end. Bottom line: the more effort your clients put forth, the less favorable their customer experience.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Execution<\/strong>. Those first three E\u2019s are rendered insignificant without execution. Sometimes, the other elements of the customer experience (expectations, efforts &amp; emotions) combine to provide temporary relief, despite dysfunctional execution. Can you execute a plan to improve your client\u2019s process, and deliver <a href=\"https:\/\/www.teledirect.com\/value-results\/\">value &amp; results<\/a>? It\u2019s all about execution, and it starts with a thorough understanding of your client\u2019s problems, carried out with a proven, practical plan of action to execute solutions.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>See How TeleDirect Helps you Execute a Winning Business Plan: Contact Us Today!<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The four E\u2019s are a collective, collaborative benchmark we use to promote and foster successful relationships with companies all over the United States.

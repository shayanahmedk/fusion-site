This is measured by setting and communicating specific goals \u2014 generally called \u201ctargets\u201d or \u201cindicators.\u201d These targets and indicators will be different depending on the industry and business. Call and contact centers tend to focus on customer satisfaction and agent performance.<\/p>\n<h3>Customer Satisfaction Metrics and KPIs<\/h3>\n<p>Customer satisfaction metrics and KPIs revolve around the experience that consumers have with your company. In the case of an outbound call center, it refers to the customer&#8217;s experience when they are on the receiving end of contact from your business. This includes things like cold calls, fundraising, callbacks or follow-ups.<\/p>\n<p>Some typical customer satisfaction KPIs for an outbound call center include:<\/p>\n<h4>Average Handle Time<\/h4>\n<p>This measures, on average, how long your customers are on the line with your agents. Ideally, your customer service calls will last under a certain length, though the ideal call length varies depending on the industry and product.<\/p>\n<h4>Customer Effort Score (CES)<\/h4>\n<p>Are your customers satisfied? CES is often determined by satisfaction surveys, and explains how easily your outgoing agents met your customers\u2019 needs.<\/p>\n<h4>Average Call Length<\/h4>\n<p>This KPI measures the average overall length of an outgoing phone call, including hold times and transfers. As with average handle time, the \u201cright\u201d length will depend on the industry.<\/p>\n<h3>Agent Performance Metrics and KPIs<\/h3>\n<p>These metrics and KPIs measure the performance of your staff \u2014 in this case, outbound call center agents. Some agent performance KPIs for an outbound call center include:<\/p>\n<h4>Call Quality<\/h4>\n<p>This assesses how well your agents perform in conversation with customers. Are they polite? Helpful? Do they use the proper scripting and verbiage?<\/p>\n<h4>Calls Per Agent<\/h4>\n<p>This KPI is a way of measuring the productivity levels of your outbound call center agents. It assesses how many outbound calls are made during a shift and whether they are all answered by customers.<\/p>\n<h4>Agent Sales Rate<\/h4>\n<p>How often are your outbound agents closing deals in an average day or week? This KPI measures how well your agents move customers through the proper <a href=\"https:\/\/www.teledirect.com\/business-solutions\/maximize-your-lead-funnel-to-close-more-sales\/\">sales funnel<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>Best Practices for Outbound Call Centers<\/h2>\n<p>So, let\u2019s say you\u2019ve been measuring your outbound call center metrics, and the results don\u2019t look promising. We know that feels like a blow, but it will be OK. Thanks to KPI tracking, you\u2019ve identified a problem and can be on the road to fixing it. Several practices help improve overall call center success. We will discuss three of the most crucial below.<\/p>\n<h4>Scripting<\/h4>\n<p>A good agent script can take your outbound call center to new heights. Not only does this allow you to formulate exactly what you want your agents to say, but you can also provide written responses to various questions and comments so the entire call flows efficiently and naturally. You can also personalize your call center experience through scripting. Your outbound agents will speak to customers according to your unique verbiage, providing a more immersive brand experience.<\/p>\n<h4>Call Monitoring<\/h4>\n<p>Ever called a company and consented to your call being recorded for quality or training purposes? That\u2019s to help measure call quality KPIs. By monitoring your outgoing calls, you can see where your agents are communicating well and where they need improvement.<\/p>\n<h4>Ongoing Training<\/h4>\n<p>In the customer service world, there\u2019s no room for complacency. By continuously training and checking in with your outbound agents, you can ensure they\u2019re providing customer support that aligns with your clientele\u2019s current needs.<\/p>\n<h2>Challenges and Solutions for Outbound Call Centers<\/h2>\n<p>If you\u2019re running your own outbound call center, you may encounter some challenges. Some of the most common issues for an outbound call center include:<\/p>\n<h4>Compliance Issues<\/h4>\n<p>Compliance refers to the legal end of running a business. Occasionally, call centers run into compliance issues relating to security breaches. This can lead to significant customer problems and, in turn, the business. The best solution to this potential challenge is to take a professional route for your outbound call center. Outsourced providers (like TeleDirect) have safeguarding measures to protect sensitive data collected during customer contact.<\/p>\n<h4>Low Answer Rates<\/h4>\n<p>You can\u2019t force folks to answer their phones. Your agents can leave engaging and personalized messages or voicemails when they don\u2019t receive an answer, with clear instructions on how to return the call. A good script will make this straightforward.<\/p>\n<h4>Call Fatigue<\/h4>\n<p>If your staff is exhausted from handling outbound calls on top of their assigned duties, that\u2019s reasonable. They\u2019re doing two jobs at once! It\u2019s time to outsource your outbound call center so they can focus on their hired responsibilities, not customer service or sales.

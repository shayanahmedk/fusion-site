Everything from revenue streams to advertising to ecommerce is, in some way, directly related to Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and more.<\/p>\n<p>Given this monumental shift in how businesses interact with their customers (and would-be customers), all the experts agree: social media has revolutionized everything. Which might be the biggest understatement of the century (so far).<\/p>\n<p>Many businesses regard these social media interactions from an outreach point of view. Some examples include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>How can I use social media to promote a new product or service?<\/li>\n<li>Will more tweets necessarily equate to more revenue?<\/li>\n<li>What are the best methods for implementing a Facebook advertising strategy?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>While these (and many other) types of social media interaction are absolutely critical for optimal business performance, it helps to remember that social media communication is a two-way street. And increasingly, customers are using social media as a portal for customer service. Thus, incoming social media communications from concerned customers demand a viable solution. If you want to boost your social media presence, you may even consider using tactics such as <a href=\"https:\/\/followerscart.com\/buy-instagram-views\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Buy Instagram Views<\/a> to increase your reach and visibility. However, it&#8217;s important to remember that the potential impact \u2013 both positive and negative \u2013 for your brand and reputation must be considered. Is your business paying attention to these trends? More to the point, are you prepared to meet customer service demands via your social media communications strategy?<\/p>\n<p>To grasp how social media customer service has grown, consider the following statistics:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>For the first time in history, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.emarketer.com\/Article\/US-Digital-Ad-Spending-Surpass-TV-this-Year\/1014469\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">digital advertising spending<\/a> \u2013 driven largely by social media sites like Facebook and Twitter \u2013 have eclipsed traditional TV ad spending.<\/li>\n<li>The popular social media video sharing site &amp; app Snapchat has more than <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2016-04-28\/snapchat-user-content-fuels-jump-to-10-billion-daily-video-views\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">10 billion daily views<\/a>. That\u2019s about 1.5 videos watched per person \u2013 for every person on the planet!<\/li>\n<li>Even \u201cnegative\u201d reports about social media use aren\u2019t so bad. Despite slower-than-expected growth last year, Twitter still exceeded the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/technology\/2016\/oct\/27\/twitter-layoffs-financial-report\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">300 million-user plateau<\/a>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Reputation Management: How Social Media can Spread your Message \u2013 and Salvage Business Relationships<\/h2>\n<p>With so much being said through social media channels, it\u2019s inevitable that some chatter will be about your business. Much of it will be positive, but there will be some negative feedback, too.<\/p>\n<p>In times past, a company\u2019s customer service department worked through traditional channels \u2013 hand-written letters (gasp!), phone conversations, and face-to-face meetings. Today, social media has become a de facto customer service portal; a good portion of your clients will reach out to your firm through Instagram, Snapchat, Twitter, Facebook and other avenues.<\/p>\n<p>If your firm doesn\u2019t have a social media outreach initiative \u2013 and your customer service should include social media-savvy messaging \u2013 your reputation can quickly take a hit.<\/p>\n<p>Thankfully, TeleDirect\u2019s business process outsourcing (BPO) call center service can supplement your social media communications with a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.teledirect.com\/services\/call-center-platform\/\">reliable, proven platform<\/a>.

Let\u2019s start by looking at each component to understand the full experience.<\/p>\n<h2>Call Center Scripting vs. Call Flow Process: What are They?<\/h2>\n<p>Building a contact center for your business? You\u2019ve probably heard the terms \u201ccall center scripting\u201d and \u201ccall flow process.\u201d These are two major facets of the customer service and call center industries. But do you know what they mean? While the two terms are connected\u2014you will likely use call center scripting within your call flow process\u2014they are not the same.<\/p>\n<p>This article will cover the basics of call flow and call center scripting. If you still have questions about these concepts and how they can help your business, please contact the TeleDirect team.<\/p>\n<h2>What is a Call Flow?<\/h2>\n<p>In the customer service world, call flow is like a blueprint that determines how each client interaction goes.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s say you run a spa. While you can\u2019t plan for specific interactions, you can identify several reasons customers might contact you. For instance, your spa clients might call your contact center to make and change bookings, ask questions, purchase gift certificates or provide feedback about their treatment. In order to provide the best customer service, you likely have an idea of how each of those calls should go, from when your customer picks up the phone until the case is closed. You are creating a call flow by taking this general concept and expanding it into a plan that can be shared with your customer service team. A call flow plan will outline everything that should happen on a customer support call for your company.<\/p>\n<p>While the call flow process relies on following a blueprint, it is not the same as a script. Instead, call flow processes are developed to encompass many customer queries and outline how things should go. That way, conversations can be organic and address your customers\u2019 unique questions and concerns.<\/p>\n<h2>What is a Call Center Answering Script?<\/h2>\n<p>A call center answering script is a customer service tool that helps incorporate your branding and company values into your support center. Many brands include call center scripting as a part of their overall call flow process. Additionally, many businesses outsource a BPO call center like TeleDirect. As a result, they will be able to seamlessly incorporate your verbiage into scripted communication that aligns with your call flow process, allowing for a more immersive and successful brand experience.<\/p>\n<h2>What is a Script Example for Call Center Services?<\/h2>\n<p>Call center scripting looks different from, say, a screenplay. It\u2019s more like a \u201cchoose your own adventure\u201d book. Every time your inbound agents answer the phone, they will have choices of on-brand, consistent greetings. This could be as simple as:<\/p>\n<p><em>\u201cGood morning\/evening\/afternoon, thank you for calling _____. My name is ___! How can I help you today?\u201d\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>\u201cHi there! You\u2019re speaking with ____ from ______. What can I do for you today?\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<p>From this point, your conversation could go in a lot of directions. Each caller will be a different person with a unique set of needs. For some, it will be their first time communicating with your business. Others will be calling back to work through a more complex issue. Your script will have a selection of responses and solutions for as many queries and problems as possible.<\/p>\n<p>If your agent or script does not have a response to a specific query, your script will also have ways to express this in a manner that is professional and reassuring to the client. These may sound like:<\/p>\n<p><em>\u201cI can\u2019t think of an immediate answer to this question, but I can find out more for you. Do you mind holding?\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>\u201cThat\u2019s a good question. I\u2019m going to find some answers for you now.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Most companies work directly with their call center service to ensure that all of their scripted options sound on brand and provide the customer experience they intend.<\/p>\n<h2>At TeleDirect, We Go With the Call Flow<\/h2>\n<p>At TeleDirect, we know how to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.teledirect.com\/industries\/tax-relief-services\/\">develop a call flow<\/a>\u2014we\u2019ve done it hundreds of times.

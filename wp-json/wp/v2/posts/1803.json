In this article, we\u2019ll help you determine these essential customer-facing skills.<\/p>\n<h2>10 Must-Have Skill Sets for Call Center Agent Teams<\/h2>\n<p>In order to provide excellent customer service, your business needs agents and representatives who can deliver. This can be a tall order\u2014after all, customer service is a complex (and incredibly important) facet of the business. Plus, not everybody is cut out for customer service. Your latest hire might be a genius when it comes to your industry, whether it\u2019s graphic design or dentistry. However, they might have little to zero customer-facing skills\u2014and that\u2019s OK. That\u2019s why a separate customer service team is so important.<\/p>\n<p>Whether you are hiring a customer service crew for the first time or looking to improve your existing one, the secret to success is knowing what skills to look for in your potential agents. We can help you <a href=\"https:\/\/www.teledirect.com\/business-solutions\/call-center-coaching-strategies\/\">perfect those skills.<\/a> At TeleDirect, we are experts in customer support and communication, and we\u2019re delighted to share our knowledge and tips with you. Read on to see what we consider the most crucial call center experience skills for you to look for when hiring customer support agents. If you have any questions, reach out to our team\u2014we\u2019d love to hear from you.<\/p>\n<h3>Excellent Communication<\/h3>\n<p>A good customer service agent or call center representative knows how to communicate with every lead, customer, and client who contacts them. This means listening to callers, truly considering their words, and responding with relevant answers. It also means being forthright. A good communicator says what they mean in a respectful way rather than using hints to get the point across. Your customers want to feel like a person, not just a faceless caller.<\/p>\n<h3>Being Customer Oriented<\/h3>\n<p>As call center agents, your customer service reps will be loyal to your company and brand. However, successful agents know that customers deserve that same loyalty. When customers contact your call center with complaints or complex questions, some agents might become defensive and make excuses. This might seem like a great way to be loyal to a company, but if the problem remains unsolved and your customer is angry or insulted, this will backfire quickly. Customer-oriented agents know that the best way to serve a business is by offering excellent support and putting clients first. They will be able to show their callers empathy and understanding while remaining loyal to company values.<\/p>\n<h3>Active Listening<\/h3>\n<p>Little words like \u201cmmhmm\u201d or \u201csure\u201d can make an enormous difference during a phone call. These little interjections are short and discreet enough not to cut your customer off or interrupt them but to allow them to see that your agents are listening and understanding them. It helps your callers feel heard.<\/p>\n<h3>Problem-Solving<\/h3>\n<p>Not every case is going to be straightforward. That\u2019s why we always look for agents with strong problem-solving skills. These individuals can assess circumstances (and sometimes think outside the box) to find the best solution to the problem at hand.<\/p>\n<h3>Working Under Pressure<\/h3>\n<p>You can\u2019t predict the nature of every call or case. That\u2019s why hiring agents who can think on their feet, handle high volumes of calls and not lose their cool during complicated or stressful situations is important. They will be able to reassure customers, reach solutions faster and positively represent your company.<\/p>\n<h3>Flexibility<\/h3>\n<p>Customer service needs don\u2019t cease when businesses close\u2014so why should your call center? Successful customer support centers offer after-hours availability. This requires you to hire flexible agents who can work across all time zones to serve more customers.<\/p>\n<h3>Working With Tech<\/h3>\n<p>You need strong technical skills for call center success. Most modern call centers utilize modern technology and software to best meet their clients needs. This provides better security and more helpful, efficient service. Your agents should have experience using different forms of technology or be open to dedicated training sessions.<\/p>\n<h3>Memory<\/h3>\n<p>Memory can be the key to personalized customer service. If a customer has a more complex issue that requires multiple calls, remembering their details are essential. Identifying a caller by their name or asking about the dog they spoke of last time can make an enormous difference to their overall experience. (Folks with less sharp memories can still accomplish this by taking notes during calls.)<\/p>\n<h3>Patience<\/h3>\n<p>Look. Nobody likes getting yelled at or dealing with a frustrated or angry caller\u2014but unfortunately, this is sometimes the reality for call center agents. Your agents will often be on the receiving end of a customer\u2019s bad day. Patience and a thick skin will be important for the sake of your agents, customers, and overall reputation.<\/p>\n<h3>Sales and Marketing<\/h3>\n<p>Great call center agents will help you close more deals. They understand your branding, are passionate about your business, and know how to speak to people about their unique needs. A call center agency can help you find great call center agents.<\/p>\n<h2>We Have the Call Center Experience Skills Your Company Needs<\/h2>\n<p>At TeleDirect, our team has been delivering first-class customer service for more than 20 years.

KPIs (or key performance indicators) are a crucial type of metric used by businesses across the globe. As the name suggests, KPIs refer to individual targets, or indicators, that concretely show how different facets of a business is performing. While some KPIs are fairly universal (like average customer retention rate), others might be more industry-specific. For instance, call center KPIs usually include targets like average wait time or first call resolution rate.<\/p>\n<h2>What Exactly Do Metrics at a Call Center Mean?<\/h2>\n<p>By measuring and tracking your contact center KPIs and metrics, you are creating a better business\u2014and that will translate to both your team and your clientele.<\/p>\n<p>By investing time into monitoring and measuring your call center performance metrics, your business can:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h3>Hit More KPIs<\/h3>\n<p>When you closely monitor your call center performance metrics, you\u2019ll have a better handle on your KPIs and where they stand.

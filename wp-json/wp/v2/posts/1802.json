We list some of our favorites and explain why they work.<\/p>\n<p>Regardless of what type of business you run or what industry you\u2019re in, one thing remains true: your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.teledirect.com\/blog\/call-centers-are-here-to-stay-not-going-away-heres-why\/\">customer interactions<\/a> are at the foundation of everything you do. How you and your team communicate with your clients and leads will determine your entire bottom line\u2014after all, there&#8217;s no quicker way to lose customers and ruin your reputation than by providing poor customer service. Sounds scary? It can be, but you have nothing to worry about if you have an excellent customer service strategy.<\/p>\n<p>One of the best ways to provide excellent customer service is through language. Words matter, and how your team speaks to your clients and leads is important. This is where call center power words come into play. These words or phrases can instill confidence and satisfaction in your customer base rather than confusion, mistrust, or offense.<\/p>\n<p>Are you unsure which customer service words to use? We\u2019ve written an essential guide to power words for customer service. If you have any questions, get in touch with our TeleDirect team. We\u2019d love to speak further about one of our favorite topics and help you develop more ways to optimize your customer service strategy.<\/p>\n<h2>Call Center Power Words: Examples That Work<\/h2>\n<p>Wondering which customer service words to use and which ones to avoid? Our simple guide will help get you started.<\/p>\n<h3>Positive Customer Power Phrase Examples<\/h3>\n<h4>Now<\/h4>\n<p>While you can\u2019t help how quickly some issues and cases are resolved, firmly using the word \u201cnow\u201d reassures your customers that your team is prioritizing their needs and working urgently to solve things.<\/p>\n<h4>Understand<\/h4>\n<p>Your customers want to feel heard. What is the best way to do this? Tell them you hear and understand them, then demonstrate that by looking for solutions.<\/p>\n<h4>Always<\/h4>\n<p>Consistency is key. When you speak about your company, use the phrase \u201calways\u201d when applicable. It shows that your company\u2019s quality is not just a case-by-case experience.<\/p>\n<h4>Pleasure<\/h4>\n<p>Words that directly express positive experiences, like pleasure, will leave a good impression on your customers. When they say \u201cthank you,\u201d be sure to remind callers that they have been a pleasure to help.<\/p>\n<h4>Change<\/h4>\n<p>When a customer has an issue, they are hoping for something to change, big or small. Using the word \u201cchange\u201d shows flexibility and the ability to offer these solutions.<\/p>\n<h3>Negative Customer Power Phrase Examples<\/h3>\n<h4>Impossible<\/h4>\n<p>The term \u201cimpossible\u201d is negative and does not instill much (if any) confidence that your team will be able to solve your customers\u2019 issue or that you even really want to try.<\/p>\n<h4>Won\u2019t<\/h4>\n<p>\u201cWon\u2019t\u201d often sounds like a refusal and can come across more negatively than intended. Instead of saying, \u201cthat won\u2019t work,\u201d try saying, \u201cthat might not work, but I am happy to give it a try.\u201d<\/p>\n<h4>May\/Might\/If<\/h4>\n<p>The terms \u201cmay,\u201d \u201cmight\u201d and \u201cif\u201d all sound innocuous enough, but they can be wishy-washy. Let\u2019s say your customer is upset that they were left waiting for an appointment. By saying, \u201cwe\u2019re sorry for the inconvenience we may have caused,\u201d you are not directly acknowledging the truth. After all, your customer has already expressed that you caused an inconvenience. The term \u201cmay\u201d turns it into a question rather than stating it as a fact, as in this example: \u201cWe are sorry for the inconvenience we caused by being late.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Please note that certain words and phrases are never acceptable in customer service, like swear words, name-calling or hate speech.<\/p>\n<h3>Factual Customer Power Phrase Examples<\/h3>\n<h4>Qualified<\/h4>\n<p>When an expert is required, customers are glad to hear that a qualified professional is involved. When appropriate, it\u2019s always ideal to mention these accolades.<\/p>\n<h4>Free<\/h4>\n<p>Everybody loves a freebie. If your company offers complimentary services, that is something to highlight in your interactions. A free service or example of your service may interest leads who would have passed your company by otherwise.<\/p>\n<h2>Power Words for Customers<\/h2>\n<p>Your customers respond better to certain words\u2014depending on your industry, those words can vary. We recommend taking a good look into your industry and what language is typically used in customer service scenarios. After all, a person can expect different language during a phone consultation with their doctor than they would with their wedding planner. Sure, the power words like \u201calways\u201d and \u201cnow\u201d might stay the same, but there will be additional verbiage specific to the industry and the company\u2019s branding and image. That\u2019s why so many companies develop scripts for their call center agents to work\u2014to stay on-brand and industry-specific.<\/p>\n<h3>Do Power Words Build Credibility?<\/h3>\n<p>Using power words shows your clients that they can trust your team to handle requests at a reliable pace and present your agents as a more confident and capable team.<\/p>\n<h2>We Have the Words to Show You Value Your Customers&#8217; Needs<\/h2>\n<p>Want to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.teledirect.com\/about-us\/\">improve your customer service?<\/a> At TeleDirect, we\u2019ve been helping American brands do just that for more than 20 years.

Continue reading to learn more about which type will work for your business.<\/p>\n<h2>What Are the Different Types of Call Centers?<\/h2>\n<p>A call center is a point of contact where a business can direct consumer queries. These contact centers exist to address all sorts of scenarios: troubleshooting and problem-solving, answering questions, giving advice, providing services, taking feedback, making bookings and dispatching services.<\/p>\n<p>Your call center requirements will vary depending on what industry you are a part of, your overall demand, how your business operates and your client needs. Some businesses need 24\/7 live agent coverage to run their contact center successfully. Others might only require staffing during business hours or even get away with automated-only services. This depends on your unique business model and needs.<\/p>\n<p>If you are not sure what type of call center would be best for your business, we\u2019ve broken down the two main types of call centers for live agent solutions and explained automated services for those who need it. Remember, if you still have questions, you can reach out to our team at (800) 776-1081 for a comprehensive chat about your business goals and needs.<\/p>\n<h2>What Types of Companies Use Call Centers?<\/h2>\n<p>Successful ones.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019d be hard-pressed to find a business that never has questions, concerns or even complaints from their customers and leads. Consumers need an easily contactable source to answer their queries when these incidents occur. In an ideal world, they reach a solution quickly. This typically happens thanks to a helpful contact center staffed with knowledgeable agents or, in some cases, a well-developed automated voice system. However, everybody knows the frustration of attempting to contact a company but being met with busy signals and long wait times. Successful companies avoid the latter situation by maintaining a well-staffed contact center.<\/p>\n<p>Good contact centers are easy to reach and staffed with passionate and well-trained agents who know to handle customer inquiries\u2014even tricky ones. The best way to provide one of these golden call centers is to outsource it. BPO contact center companies have dedicated their entire business to developing high-quality call centers that are an extension of your business. They stick to your branding, values and rhetoric so that you can provide amazing customer service to every caller, every time.<\/p>\n<h2>What Are the Different Types of Call Centers<\/h2>\n<p>The main 3 types of service call centers are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h3>Live Inbound<\/h3>\n<p>A live <a href=\"https:\/\/www.teledirect.com\/services\/inbound\/\">inbound call center<\/a> is staffed by a team of trained, experienced agents. They answer every phone call that your company receives. This team of agents will be trained in your business practices and values. They can even work with customized scripts to ensure that their language matches your branding. Many of these call centers operate 24 hours a day.<\/p>\n<p>In instances where your call center team can\u2019t handle a case or query, your live inbound agents can quickly escalate the call to the appropriate department and ensure swift resolution.<\/li>\n<li>\n<h3>Live Outbound<\/h3>\n<p>A live <a href=\"https:\/\/www.teledirect.com\/services\/outbound\/\">outbound call center<\/a> is also staffed with trained, professional agents. However, these agents will call your customers and leads rather than answer the phone. Outbound call centers are a great way to follow up on leads, raise funds, conduct surveys, conveniently get back to customers regarding inquiries, deliver test results, remind customers about appointments and much more.<\/li>\n<li>\n<h3>Automated<\/h3>\n<p>With an automated call center, no live agents are answering the phone. Instead, an automated service takes that job. This service is called Interactive Voice Response (IVR), and it uses innovative technology to recognize and properly answer basic customer queries. While IVR call centers can\u2019t always offer solutions to specific problems, they can answer basic questions and even escalate more complicated queries to your live agent team. Incorporating an IVR system can reduce call volume for your live agents, allowing for a more efficient call center. See why live call agent is better for your business.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Find the Best Call Center to Fit Your Needs<\/h2>\n<p>Does your brand need live support, outbound calls, automated answering or a combination of everything?

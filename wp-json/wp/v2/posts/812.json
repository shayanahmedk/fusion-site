Regardless of your particular business sector, TeleDirect has the solution and call center technology in place to help you connect with clients.<\/p>\n<p>One of the fastest-growing segments of our own client base is within the healthcare industry. Hospitals, critical care centers, ERs, and urgent care facilities all demand a different type of service, due to a variety of factors:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Clients are patients<\/strong>. For most industries, customer care revolves around marketing initiatives and addressing client concerns &amp; complaints. The healthcare sector demands proficiency in these areas, plus an extra level of client care; in this case, \u201ccustomers\u201d equate to patients. Given this unique dynamic for the healthcare industry, most patient care facilities demand a responsive, rapid, and ultra-reliable call center platform \u2013 one that\u2019s able to process critical <a href=\"https:\/\/www.teledirect.com\/services\/outbound\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">outbound communication<\/a>, while at the same time handle 24\/7\/365 inbound calls.<\/li>\n<li><strong>HIPAA requirements<\/strong>. Since 1996, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) regulation for healthcare organizations has redefined how patient information is handled. In order to operate effectively in this field, HIPAA compliance isn\u2019t just a luxury or nice-to-have. It\u2019s absolutely mandatory.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Security concerns<\/strong>. Data security is paramount, due in part to HIPAA regulations. Personal patient information requires a technological subset and structure to simply deal with threats. Thankfully for TeleDirect clients, our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.teledirect.com\/value-results\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">information security standards<\/a> are among the most stringent in the BPO call center sector. And that\u2019s great news for you \u2013 and your patients!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>TeleDirect is simply the most effective and affordable solution for your healthcare group\u2019s call center needs. Why have we become a preferred BPO call center provider for emergency rooms, consultation firms, hospitals and other healthcare organizations? A big part of our success deals with service capability for healthcare-specific needs, particularly when it comes to HIPAA compliance and patient scheduling management.<\/p>\n<h2>HIPAA Compliance \u2013 Your Healthcare Group\u2019s First and Foremost Concern<\/h2>\n<p>Any healthcare organization requires HIPAA compliance to stay in business. One minor mishap can pull HIPAA privileges, which would have a negative impact on your ability to serve patients.

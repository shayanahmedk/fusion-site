Remember \u201cwater cooler chat?\u201d What used to be a harmless method for casual communication with co-workers suddenly seemed off-limits forever. Same goes for birthday parties at the office, team-building exercises, and a thousand other things.<\/p>\n<p>How can your office workspace return to normal after a global pandemic? Social distancing in the office will no doubt be encouraged by authorities like the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO), not to mention state and local agencies.<\/p>\n<p>Remote ways of working aren\u2019t going away, but the farther we get from the worst ravages of COVID-19, the more likely open space office best practices are ready to go. Some sort of hybrid (remote \/ office based) working patters will likely become the norm, which means office managers and office workspace planners need to start thinking about social distancing in the office, effective office workspace layout, and more.<\/p>\n<p>No matter what type of work schedule you\u2019re looking at, TeleDirect\u2019s business process outsourcing (BPO) platform assists your business or non-profit with everything from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.teledirect.com\/services\/inbound-2\/\">inbound<\/a> &amp; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.teledirect.com\/services\/outbound\/\">outbound<\/a> services to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.teledirect.com\/services\/lead-response-management-2\/\">lead response management<\/a> and much more.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019ve already offered tips &amp; tricks for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.teledirect.com\/business-solutions\/strategies-to-improve-your-call-center\/\">improving your call center<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.teledirect.com\/business-solutions\/different-methods-to-increase-your-customer-lifetime-value\/\">increasing customer lifetime value<\/a>. Now, let\u2019s look at actually improving your employees\u2019 lives, period, as they return to the office!<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Planning Your Office Workspace \u2013 Social Distancing in the Office, Open Space Strategies &amp; More<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Just because everyone is returning to the office, that doesn\u2019t mean everything will return to pre-pandemic measures ASAP. Here a few things to consider as you plan and configure your office workspace layout:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Hello cubicle, my old friend<\/strong>. While it seems like open space office best practices are all everyone is talking about, COVID-19 showed why private, personal spaces are still valid. So consider going back to a cubicle configuration for your post-COVID office workspace. And let\u2019s be honest \u2013 not everyone loves the idea of working shoulder-to-shoulder in community office spaces.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Make good use of conference rooms<\/strong>. Smart office workspace layout includes making the most of larger spaces. Take your conference rooms, for example. With Zoom, Teams and other remote applications, including TeleDirect\u2019s cloud-based <a href=\"https:\/\/www.teledirect.com\/services\/call-center-platform\/\">call center platform<\/a>, the days of packed conference rooms might be nearing the end. So, make the space count by turning them into less densely crowded \u201cofficles,\u201d with room for a handful of people. You could even add desktop panels to divide the space as your employees see fit.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Windows &gt; forced air<\/strong>. If you\u2019re fortunate enough to work somewhere with temperate year-round climate, open the windows more. A constant supply of fresh air not only makes sense from a viral load perspective, but it\u2019s a great way to keep your workers invigorated and feeling fresh. Sure, not everyone works in San Diego, but open your office windows whenever possible \u2013 it\u2019s great for physical and mental health!<\/li>\n<li><strong>Move outside<\/strong>. To expand on the point above, some companies have already established outdoor workspaces for workers. Weather permitting, this is an ideal way to simultaneously improve mental health and discourage viruses and diseases at the office!<\/li>\n<li><strong>Deploy hand sanitizer stations<\/strong>. Look for hand sanitizing stations to become part of the post-COVID office workspace. Put dispensers in larger conference rooms, hallways, lunch rooms and more.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>For more recommendations, please visit the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/coronavirus\/2019-ncov\/community\/office-buildings.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CDC\u2019s guidelines<\/a> for office workspaces.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Need Assistance with Call Center, Client Communication &amp; More?

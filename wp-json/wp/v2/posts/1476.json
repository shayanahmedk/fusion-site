At TeleDirect, we are experts on how to manage a call center efficiently in the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.teledirect.com\/industries\/financial-services\/\">finance sector<\/a>! Today, we\u2019re here to share our top three most important practices for financial organizations to remember when running a call center. If you have any questions or want our personalized help with your business, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.teledirect.com\/industries\/financial-services\/#contact-form\">get in touch<\/a> with our team any time.<\/p>\n<h2>Financial Industry Best Practices for Customer Service<\/h2>\n<p>It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re a financial adviser or investment manager, run a bank or credit union, or in the private equity and venture capital business. Your ROI isn\u2019t the only one that matters! If you are in charge of a financial institution, your clients put an enormous amount of trust into your business\u2014that\u2019s an investment too. Give them the return they deserve by offering the best customer experience and support possible. To offer the best possible customer care and experience to your financial consumers, we suggest engaging in these three important practices:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<h3>Play by the Rules<\/h3>\n<p>If you\u2019re running a call center, it\u2019s imperative that you pay close attention to the legal side of things.<\/p>\n<p>While there is not any specific legislation surrounding call centers in the finance sector, many companies develop their own comprehensive call center rules and regulations for employees to ensure the highest quality service. If you plan to work with a business process outsourcing (BPO) service for your call center, they will be able to help you develop and implement these regulations. At TeleDirect, we even offer a dedicated (and secure) client portal for key performance indicators, tracking and data analysis to ensure that we are meeting your needs.<\/p>\n<p>Please note that there are some federal laws surrounding the operation of call centers in general, like the Telephone Consumer Protection Act. (Some industries, like healthcare, do have specific laws surrounding call centers.) This is another reason we suggest that financial organizations invest in an outsourced call center\u2014these businesses know the industry back to front. Their agents will always comply with federal law, and they will be able to ensure that your contact center always stays within required legislation.<\/li>\n<li>\n<h3>Offer Flexible Availability and Communication<\/h3>\n<p>Bankers and managers, it&#8217;s time to think outside the 9 a.m.-5 p.m. box.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, the finance world runs pretty staunchly on a Monday-Friday schedule. However, anyone with experience in the industry knows that issues, questions and even emergencies can arise after banks close at five. When these things happen, your customers need somewhere to turn immediately, not on the next work day. This is where a more flexible contact center comes in.<\/p>\n<p>In a globalized world where we make financial choices with the click of a button and bank from your bed at midnight, consumers need after hours support options more than ever. This can be delivered by a high-quality BPO contact center company like TeleDirect; we provide everything you need to give your customers the support and communication they deserve, whenever necessary. This includes 24-hour live inbound agents, automated services and the options to cross-transfer and escalate when appropriate.<\/li>\n<li>\n<h3>Let the Experts Do Their Job<\/h3>\n<p>You\u2019re in finance, not customer service. You\u2019ve got things to worry about other than how to manage a call center efficiently. Why should your team be expected to handle complex customer support queries and cases\u2014especially when they can arise at any hour?<\/p>\n<p>This is what helps the most successful financial institutions stay at the top; they know that, while outsourcing their call center services is an investment, it\u2019s one worth making. By assigning communication and customer support responsibilities over to your (already busy) team, both your staff and clients will feel the consequences. That\u2019s why so many financial teams are making the choice to add an outsourced contact center service to their business strategy.<\/p>\n<p>A high-quality outsourced call center will always work as an extension of your business. They\u2019ll answer and make calls using your scripts and verbiage, learn and understand your ethos, help with organization and offer round-the-clock availability to your clients. This keeps your entire customer service experience consistent with your overall branding and business strategy, but takes some pressure off your staff. Plus, by allowing your team more time and space to focus on the jobs they were hired to do, your employees won\u2019t be the only ones to benefit. Customers will enjoy an overall easier and more personal experience\u2014and that can only lead to better business.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>While there are several dedicated <a href=\"https:\/\/www.teledirect.com\/industries\/financial-services\/\">financial call center BPO services<\/a> in the US, one stands above the rest: TeleDirect.

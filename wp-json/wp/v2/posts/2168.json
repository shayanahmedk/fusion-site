This technology went mainstream in the early 2000s and has steadily gained traction in the business sector. With the advent of the remote workforce, which doesn&#8217;t appear to be going away any time soon, VoIP became a standard, resolving many pain points while reducing costs. According to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.businessnewsdaily.com\/8924-voip-for-business.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Business News Daily<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, over one-third of businesses use a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.teledirect.com\/services\/inbound\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">VoIP phone<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> system <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">today<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this comprehensive guide, we&#8217;ll explore the technology behind these systems and the features they bring to the table. Discover if a <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">VoIP phone line<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is right for your business and how our team at TeleDirect uses this technology to enhance customer service. If you&#8217;re wondering, \u201c<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.teledirect.com\/blog\/effective-inbound-call-strategy\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is VoIP, and how does it work<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">?\u201d read on.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What Is a VoIP Phone?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">VoIP phones<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are designed to use VoIP technology to place and receive calls over an IP network. Because they use the internet, you no longer need to run copper wires for regular landlines or make calls via a mobile network. An added benefit is that your employees are no longer fixed to their desks.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These phones work anywhere, whether in a boardroom, at an off-site meeting or from home. If you have a high-speed internet connection, you can use VoIP. Have you used Google Voice or Skype? Then, you&#8217;ve used VoIP.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What Are the Types of VoIP Phones?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are three basic types of <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">VoIP phones<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. One is a hardware-based VoIP desk phone and is much like traditional phones. They include a caller ID display, a touchpad and a microphone or speakerphone.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The other involves installing software on the user&#8217;s mobile device or computer. The interface may include a caller ID display and touchpad. Headsets <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">might <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">be required.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both phone types offer similar features, including call conferencing, call transfer and voicemail. In addition to these standard features, many offer text messaging, team chat, video calling, auto attendant, call waiting, call analytics and call recording. You can get multiple phone numbers and <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">quickly<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> route calls. Some even integrate with CRM software.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can also use existing landlines by retrofitting your analog phones with an adapter.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Does VoIP Phone Technology Work?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you use VoIP, your voice converts into a digital signal so it can be sent over the internet. It&#8217;s then reverted into an analog signal by the phone at the other end. Advancements in technology make this conversion effortless, with no special equipment required.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You do need to subscribe to a <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">VoIP phone<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> system provider. These providers offer VoIP services, such as compatible devices and software. They&#8217;re responsible for connecting the calls to other telephone networks.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Benefits of VoIP Call Center Solutions<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Businesses and call centers are switching over to <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">VoIP phones<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for several reasons. The following represent a few of their many benefits.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Improved Call Quality<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.teledirect.com\/blog\/the-cost-of-a-missed-call\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wireless VoIP phone<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> systems are capable of high-definition voice. This technology improves the quality over traditional landlines, making it clearer and more natural.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reduced Costs<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">VoIP phone<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> users save money in multiple ways. You no longer need telephone service, saving on long-distance charges. Most <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">wireless VoIP phone<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> service providers also offer unlimited domestic calling. You don\u2019t require an <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">on-site<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> private branch exchange that creates the telephone networks that manage calls.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That means no copper phone lines or telephony switches and reduced costs for expansions and upgrades. And, like <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.teledirect.com\/services\/inbound\/tier-1-tech-support\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">VoIP call center solutions<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, you can use the existing internet infrastructure.

At TeleDirect, we consider our agents the backbone of our company. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That\u2019s how<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> we\u2019ve gone from an eight-chair answering service to a national business process outsourcer. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.teledirect.com\/blog\/ai-to-replace-call-center-agents\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AI call center<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> technology, however, has made significant inroads into the industry. While, in our opinion, it can never replace live agents, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.teledirect.com\/blog\/automated-answering-service-vs-live-call-agent\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">call center AI<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> offers remarkable advancements that can transform the experience for customers and business owners.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From machine learning to natural language processing, it understands the spoken <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">word. The<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> more it listens, the more it learns. It analyzes and processes vast amounts of data, enabling it to excel at data-driven tasks and data-based decisions. These abilities provide call centers with tremendous opportunities to improve customer support.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the time it takes an agent to find one answer to a technical question, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.teledirect.com\/services\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">artificial intelligence call center<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> technology has scanned through the manual. It can direct the agent to each step required to resolve the customer&#8217;s pain point. Thank you, AI. What it can&#8217;t do is empathize. Well, it can sound like it&#8217;s empathizing. It certainly knows all the phrases humans use when displaying compassion. Unfortunately, your customer at the other end of the line knows that the virtual assistant is heartless and void of genuine concern.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.semrush.com\/blog\/artificial-intelligence-stats\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Semrush<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> reports that 40% of marketing and sales departments prioritize machine learning and AI technology. You may wonder what that has to do with a call center. At TeleDirect, we&#8217;re an extension of your team, and our team is extensively trained in <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.teledirect.com\/services\/outbound\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">upselling and lead generation<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We connect with qualified leads and new sales opportunities using<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> CRM data analysis. It&#8217;s a brave new world we live in, and AI has the opportunity to transform it.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Understanding Call Center AI\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To understand <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.teledirect.com\/blog\/5-reasons-to-hire-a-call-center-service\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AI for call center<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> uses and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.teledirect.com\/services\/contact-center-services\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">how artificial intelligence is transforming contact centers<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, we must first explore the darker side. Some agencies are replacing call agents with <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AI-powered<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> virtual agents. Others are using <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">artificial intelligence<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to scan large amounts of information and conversations and then telling agents what to say and the exact words to use when speaking with a customer. And, if they don\u2019t? They\u2019re penalized. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That\u2019s <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the darker side of AI, akin to the latest dramas in which AI becomes the boss, and humans <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">are<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the assistants.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The brighter side of <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AI call center<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> technology is its ability to automate repetitive tasks through robotic process automation. Filling out forms, record keeping and data entry are in its wheelhouse, giving call agents more time to focus on customer service and resolving complex questions or grievances. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That\u2019s<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> just the tip of the iceberg of the many benefits AI brings to call centers.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">6 Ways AI Benefits Call Centers<\/span><\/h2>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Routing to the Appropriate Agent\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Streamlining workflow improves efficiency, productivity and communication, three essential elements of a successful call center. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Artificial intelligence call center<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> technology may answer phones, find out why a person is calling and then direct them to the appropriate agent with the answers they seek. This agent <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">might<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> be better suited for product knowledge or customer complaint resolutions. It even considers personalities. That&#8217;s a much better experience than being continually routed to different people in search of someone who can help.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Generates Powerful Insights\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AI for call centers<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can analyze data that includes written and spoken comments. As they speak with a customer, call agents receive AI\u2019s insights. Using their human insights, the agent can determine the best course of action, providing faster and exceptional customer service. AI can also create customer profiles based on past experiences, conversations and orders. These profiles enable agents to upsell and offer greater value and a better experience.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Access Information Quickly<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of AI&#8217;s best traits is its ability to access information quickly. It can collect data from separate systems and unify it for meaningful connections. It can search databases and find answers to challenging questions. Is your customer experiencing a technical glitch? AI can help agents find the needed steps to resolve the malfunction or user error almost instantly.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Help Call Agents Make Decisions<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As humans, we may not sleep well one night, or an event in our lives may leave us off balance. In other words, we\u2019re not always perfect or at our best. Fortunately, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AI call center<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> technology is. While call center agents don\u2019t want to be superseded and placed in the passenger seat, they appreciate AI\u2019s support.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For instance, a customer calls wondering which product suits their needs best. In the time an agent researches the possibilities, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">call center AI<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> has come up with the answer. It may even recommend additional or different products that cater to their objectives. Can call agents do that as well? Absolutely. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However,<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> AI saved some time <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">in this instance<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which your customers always appreciate.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Determining Customer Sentiment<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AI can also use its powers for sentiment analysis. This gives it the remarkable ability to analyze what words are used, a customer&#8217;s tone of voice and their cadence or the rhythms in their speech patterns. This analysis determines what a customer genuinely wants and <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">whether the conversation provides<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> it. This information enables call agents to switch gears or direct the conversation accordingly, increasing customer satisfaction.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Speed Up Interactions<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thanks to technological input, fast customer service is expected. Prioritizing customers\u2019 questions and orders promotes trust in your brand and, ultimately, brand loyalty. Speeding up response times and personalizing service are benefits of integrating artificial intelligence.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How TeleDirect Can Help Achieve Customer Success\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Will call centers be fully automated one day?

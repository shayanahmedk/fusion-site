Specifically, the acquisition of new clients and the retention of long-time customers. For those faithful clients who\u2019ve been with you a while, knowing how to improve customer lifetime value (CLV) is a critical element of solid business growth.<\/p>\n<p>But what exactly is CLV, and how can you use it to boost your bottom line? <a href=\"https:\/\/www.teledirect.com\/\">TeleDirect<\/a> knows a thing or two about how to increase customer lifetime value \u2013 after all, our business process outsourcing (BPO) services provide exceptional <a href=\"https:\/\/www.teledirect.com\/services\/call-center-platform\/\">call center solutions<\/a> for small, medium and large businesses everywhere.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>What is CLV?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Simply put, customer lifetime value is the total net profit your business makes from one customer since day one. Thus, the customer lifetime value of a prospective customer is zero. For customers who\u2019ve used your products or services for years, the customer lifetime value formula is pretty straightforward.<\/p>\n<p>For example, let\u2019s say you have a lawncare service. One of your customers pays $75 per month, 9 months per year. That\u2019s $675 per year. If that customer has used your lawncare services for 10 years, the customer lifetime value of that client is $6,750. Obviously, keeping regular clients for years and decades is a great way to improve your bottom line.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s in your firm\u2019s best interest to master this customer lifetime value formula. While many businesses focus on acquiring new clients through lead response and other methods, it helps to optimize CLV for the clients you already have.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s look at some ways on how to improve customer lifetime value.<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<h3><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1355\" src=\"https:\/\/www.teledirect.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/CLV_infographic_r011-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"608\" height=\"2560\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.teledirect.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/CLV_infographic_r011-scaled.jpg 608w, https:\/\/www.teledirect.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/CLV_infographic_r011-71x300.jpg 71w, https:\/\/www.teledirect.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/CLV_infographic_r011-243x1024.jpg 243w, https:\/\/www.teledirect.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/CLV_infographic_r011-768x3233.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.teledirect.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/CLV_infographic_r011-365x1536.jpg 365w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 608px) 100vw, 608px\" \/><\/h3>\n<h3>Share this Image On Your Site<\/h3>\n<p><textarea style=\"width: 540px; height: 120px;\">&lt;\/p&gt;<br \/>\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please include attribution to Teledirect with this graphic.&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;<br \/>\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#8217;https:\/\/www.teledirect.com\/different-methods-to-increase-your-customer-lifetime-value\/&#8217;&gt;&lt;img src=&#8217;http:\/\/www.teledirect.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/CLV_infographic_r011-scaled.jpg&#8217; alt=&#8217;Customer Lifetime Value&#8217; 540px border=&#8217;0&#8242; \/&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;<br \/>\n&lt;p&gt;<\/textarea><\/p>\n<h3><strong>How to Maximize Customer Lifetime Value<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Here are five proven ways to boost customer lifetime value:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Offer high-value upsells.

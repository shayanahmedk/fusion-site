Otherwise, they will not be loyal to your brand and might even spread the word to others about their negative experience. Unfortunately, many companies aren\u2019t sure how to create a customer support strategy that suits their business and customers\u2019 needs. This often leads to speculation over which type of answering service is better: an automated answering service or live call agent.<\/p>\n<p>We see merits to both types of systems. Automated phone services certainly have their place and can be quite handy for specific queries or needs. However, we are massive proponents of the use of live agents in customer service\u2014they can fix complex problems in a way that automated services do not. Every company and industry has different needs, which also goes for their contact centers.<\/p>\n<p>Today, we will discuss the pros and cons of using an automated answering service vs. live call agents. If you have questions or need support in deciding how to proceed with your company\u2019s contact center, get in touch with our team. Our live agents will be happy to help you figure out the best path for your brand.<\/p>\n<h2>Automated Answering Service<\/h2>\n<p>In some situations, an automated \u201crobot\u201d can handle customer calls well. This is especially true when making <a href=\"https:\/\/www.teledirect.com\/services\/inbound\/reservation-services\/\">reservations<\/a> or simple changes to pre-existing purchases or receiving \u201cboilerplate\u201d type answers (like checking a schedule.) However, it\u2019s less helpful when your clients have complex issues to resolve or questions relating to their specific circumstances.<\/p>\n<p>To help you decide if an automated answering service is the right option for your company, we\u2019ve created a simple list of pros and cons.<\/p>\n<h3>Pros and Cons of Automated Phone Services<\/h3>\n<h4>Pros<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>It Can Be Fast and Efficient<\/strong><br \/>\nNot all queries are complex. When a customer has a simple question, an automated answering service can give them answers quickly. All it takes is a few minutes and pressing some buttons\u2014no wait time or conversation necessary!<\/li>\n<li><strong>It Can Help Reduce Live Inbound Volume<\/strong><br \/>\nHigh call volumes can be stressful for even the most skilled agents, leading to long wait times and lost calls. This is where automated services shine\u2014simple queries can be taken on the automated side, giving your agents more time and space to answer more complex questions.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Cons<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>It\u2019s Not Always Accurate<\/strong><br \/>\nSometimes, automated answering services miss the mark. Often, customers are given a list of options and numbers to press and find that nothing offered fits their actual query. This leads to dissatisfaction on their part\u2014and that can mean losing them as a customer.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Customers Don\u2019t Always Like It<\/strong><br \/>\nWhen customers have to call a support center, they are often in distress or frustrated with a situation. The customer can become more aggravated when they are being \u201chelped\u201d by a robotic voice that doesn\u2019t seem to understand the problem. Unhappy customers won\u2019t return. They might even post about their negative experience online.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Shared or Dedicated Contact Agent<\/h2>\n<p>Many companies outsource a team of shared or dedicated live agents for their contact center. Live agents allow for a person-to-person experience for their customers and leads.<\/p>\n<p>If you are considering investing in a BPO shared or dedicated contact agent service, check out these pros and cons to help make the decision.<\/p>\n<h3>Pros and Cons of a Phone Attendant Service<\/h3>\n<h4>Pros<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Live Agents Reach Real Resolutions<\/strong><br \/>\nLive agents can listen to your clients\u2019 and leads\u2019 unique circumstances and help them find the fastest path to resolution. No time is wasted with automated options that don\u2019t exactly fit. Instead, your caller will be able to discuss their situation or question in detail so that the correct protocol can occur. This personal contact leads to quicker resolutions and happier customers.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Your Brand Will Always Be Front and Center<\/strong><br \/>\nOutsourced call center agents work like an extension of your team; they will learn everything about your business ethos and mission, your branding and verbiage and how you want specific issues to be handled. You can even work with your BPO team to create customized scripts for your live agents. This customer service experience creates a more cohesive transition from your storefront and social media to your call center.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Happier Customers<\/strong><br \/>\nWhen your customers call you, they hope for a straightforward and painless experience that meets all their needs and resolves any issues. If your call center team can provide that, that\u2019s a massive win for both of you. They will walk away feeling respected and satisfied with their experience. Your company will thrive as a result. Happy customers lead to a good reputation.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Cons<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>You Didn\u2019t Invest in It Sooner<\/strong><br \/>\nOnce you introduce a team of live call center agents to your business, you\u2019ll wonder why you waited so long to do so.

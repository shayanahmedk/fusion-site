Specialized agent training<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like your employees, we consider our agents the foundation of our business. We hold them to high standards and appreciate their work ethic in return. When <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">outsourcing a call center<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, highly trained and professional agents are the cornerstone of your success.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>2. Full-service capability<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many businesses consider <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">call centers for hire<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> when they&#8217;re unable to respond to customers in a timely manner. But a call center should be so much more!<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.teledirect.com\/services\/inbound\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Inbound services<\/span><\/a> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">should offer everything customer service-related. This includes answering complex questions, bookings, purchases and payments.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.teledirect.com\/services\/outbound\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Outbound services<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> involve reaching out to your current customers or potential leads. This includes assisting with sales, upselling and lead generation, helping you grow your business! It also includes following up with customers, enhancing engagement and creating a personalized experience.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Surveys and market research can help you gather valuable feedback and increase customer loyalty. Do you know your target market and what they&#8217;re looking for in your products or services? We can help! Too many businesses miss out on this vital service by<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> outsourcing a call center <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">that only focuses on answering calls.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>3. Reliable and available 24\/7\/365<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your customers are counting on your call service to be there for them when your team isn&#8217;t available. To accomplish this, you need to <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">hire a call center<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that offers round-the-clock service and possesses a reliable infrastructure that ensures it remains up and running in a secure manner. At TeleDirect, we partner with Amazon Web Services and Twilio to operate our global cloud infrastructure. It doesn&#8217;t get any more secure and reliable than that.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>4. Experience in your industry<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While call centers don&#8217;t need to be experts in your field, having some experience in your industry ensures seamless support and professional communication. With over 25 years of experience in the industry, you can count on our extensive knowledge in<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.teledirect.com\/industries\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">multiple industries<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>5. Align with your company culture<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because your<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.teledirect.com\/services\/inbound\/customer-service\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">call center hire<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> will represent your company, you need to ensure their company culture aligns with your own. How they treat their employees and the values they hold will reflect in the service they provide.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>6. Ensure secure information<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">hire a call center<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, they gain access to your customers&#8217; information and your business&#8217;s procedures. This information must be secured. Several companies have experienced significant data breaches, such as Equifax, T-Mobile, and Chick-fil-A. Once you lose customer trust, it&#8217;s difficult to get it back. At TeleDirect, we follow the highest information security standards, protecting you and your customers&#8217; data.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Common Pitfalls to Avoid<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfortunately, hiring the wrong call center can result in serious consequences for your business. To avoid any issues, make sure to avoid the following typical pitfalls.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Hiring a call center<\/b><b> that can&#8217;t handle your volume<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Depending on the industry and business structure, some companies receive a lot of calls every day. Make sure you <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">hire a call center <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">with the manpower to provide the best customer experience. If your customers experience long wait times, your <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">call center hire <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">could do more harm than good.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Lack of reporting and analytics<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Some key metrics include information on the customers who call in and the results associated with each call. Does the call center provide performance analytics, or how long agents are on the phone with your clients? If this essential data is missing, it may be time to look elsewhere.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Lack of empathy and follow-up<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Following up is critical to a business&#8217;s success, yet many call centers fail to perform this essential act. At TeleDirect, we leverage phone calls, SMS messaging and social media to remain in contact with your customers, ensuring they know you care and helping retain each one.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><b>Ensure All Your Call Center Requirements are Locked In \u2013 Contact TeleDirect Today!<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There\u2019s no official guidebook on how to <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">hire a call center.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Make the right call when <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">hiring a call center<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and reach out to TeleDirect today.

From high-volume orders to a swell in customer service calls, your call center often determines how well you\u2019ll handle the upcoming holiday mayhem \u2013 and, more importantly, if those same customers will still be calling back during the NEXT holiday season!<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.teledirect.com\/\">TeleDirect\u2019s<\/a> business processing outsourcing (BPO) expertise, including our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.teledirect.com\/services\/call-center-platform\/\">call center platform<\/a> and contact center services, enable your business to keep pace with ultra-busy business periods, including the always important holiday season.<\/p>\n<p>We know how to handle the holiday call season; we\u2019re the preferred call center solutions for small, medium and large businesses and non-profits all across the U.S. Our communication tools and resources help any firm stay current with increased call volumes, manage after-hours requests and provide each client the individual attention they deserve.<\/p>\n<p>How can you manage higher than normal call volumes during the holidays? Keep reading to find out!<\/p>\n<h3>It\u2019s the <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">Most Wonderful<\/span> Busiest Time of the Year: Handling Hectic Call Schedules for the Holidays<\/h3>\n<p>Holiday sales usually drive the boost in calls to customer contact centers. As a general rule of thumb, retailers aim to increase sales by approximately 10% from Halloween through the New Year. Consequently, customers have questions about new products, and call in with concerns regarding recently purchased products and services.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s say your business indeed boosts sales 10% for the next three months. Given the relatively large increase in corresponding customers, your call center may see a 10-20% surplus in calls \u2013 or more!<\/p>\n<p>Is your business prepared to manage these outsized customer service demands? It helps to have a plan in place. Here are a few recommended actions from our BPO call center consultants:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Document everything \u2013 especially mistakes<\/strong>. Recording calls is a good first start. After all, if you don\u2019t have record of how, why and when you\u2019re handling customer service calls, it\u2019s impossible to know what you\u2019re doing right, let alone doing wrong. Our professionally trained agents are a big help in this regard!<\/li>\n<li><strong>Get into the analytics game<\/strong>. In keeping with the above point, handling increased customer service calls during the holidays is easier, assuming you have a historical record to compare peak volume periods. Timely data, analytics, convenient dashboard info and other metrics allow your entire customer support team to handle present challenges, simply because they\u2019ve already anticipated those ultra-busy activity periods.

In tandem with your call center, it also helps to expand the ways in which you communicate with customers. From social media to proprietary apps to chat portals, there are useful ways to add value to your customer service matrix, even as you lessen the burden on your main contact center infrastructure.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Bolster your call staff<\/strong>.

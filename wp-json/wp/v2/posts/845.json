The average person in the United States spends almost $10,000 per year on health insurance and care costs, and total healthcare spending is nearly one-fifth of the total U.S. Gross Domestic Product (GDP).<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.modernhealthcare.com\/article\/20160713\/news\/160719963\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Medicaid enrollment will eventually ease<\/a>, but not for another decade or so. Still, the growing rolls of healthcare workers \u2013 nearly 1,000,000 new jobs were added in 2015 and 2016 alone \u2013 illustrate the increasing demand for patient care.<\/p>\n<p>As hospitals, emergency rooms, specialized care centers and other healthcare organizations struggle to manage patient care requirements, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.teledirect.com\/industries\/healthcare\/\">call answering services<\/a> and patient call centers are helping to meet the challenge. More patient health information, detailed care strategies and greater enrollment figures put considerable stress on hospital administrative staff. Finding a leaner, more efficient way to handle patient calls and distribute information in a confidential manner is one of the primary challenges facing hospitals today.<\/p>\n<p>Medical call centers used to be a luxury. Now, they\u2019re a necessity. How does a medical call center enhance hospital care? And why is a hospital answering service considered an indispensable part of total patient care? Here are 11 reasons why medical call centers are a necessity for all hospitals:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Insurance Assurance<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Questions and concerns about health insurance plans comprise a significant portion of patient \u2013 healthcare provider interaction. Frequent legislative changes, confusing co-payment structures and endless billing queries requires a dedicated, on-demand solution to keep patients up-to-date with the latest information \u2013 and also confident they\u2019re getting the services they need.<\/p>\n<p>Today\u2019s advanced medical call centers offer health insurance call support for the most pressing patient demands. This service creates short-term confidence \u2013 patients are assured their healthcare group is on top of ever-changing insurance protocols \u2013 and also improves any hospital\u2019s long-term patient care strategy. An <a href=\"https:\/\/www.teledirect.com\/industries\/insurance\/\">insurance support center<\/a> is just one part of TeleDirect\u2019s comprehensive suite of services for hospitals, specialty care groups, healthcare networks and other organizations. In order to improve healthcare call center performance, optimizing your healthcare organization\u2019s overall insurance data stream can\u2019t be emphasized enough.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Patient Satisfaction Monitoring<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Are your patients satisfied with your current menu of healthcare services? If so, how can you continue to assure the highest-quality care? And if not, which areas should your organization focus on for long-term improvement. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.teledirect.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/CaseStudy_Healthcare.pdf\">TeleDirect\u2019s proven techniques<\/a> for enhanced patient outreach \u2013 including a strong focus on patient survey responses \u2013 helps any healthcare group stay on-point with customer concerns.<\/p>\n<p>Many healthcare groups attempt to track patient satisfaction, but many patients remain \u201coff the grid\u201d \u2013 seemingly undetectable by conventional contact methods; in many instances, more than 25% of patients have never responded to surveys. Giving these patients a feedback portal is critical to determine which services need improvement, and which ones currently exceed patient expectations.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Worry-Free Appointment Processing<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Many hospitals dedicate a considerable portion of administrative hours to set, confirm and change patient office appointments. To help streamline this time-consuming process, some medical call centers provide an automated patient appointment service.<\/p>\n<p>How does an appointment setting tool benefit medical practice operations?<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Accuracy<\/strong> \u2013 automated call center appointment setting services provide an extra level of accuracy and also prevent double-booking.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Reliability<\/strong> \u2013 from small, specialized medical centers to large, full-service hospitals, accuracy and appointments isn\u2019t the only thing; it\u2019s everything. Having a reliable appointment setting call center avoid common pitfalls associated with a hospital\u2019s frantic daily, weekly and monthly schedules.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Streamlined confirmation<\/strong> \u2013 just to double-check, TeleDirect\u2019s call answering platform and appointment setting services follow up with confirmation for both patient and care provider.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>When combined with a hospital or healthcare group answering service, call center appointment setting provides much-needed flexibility to better manage patient care across the health continuum.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Brand Adherence<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>While hospitals and care providers are rightly concerned about patient satisfaction with call center performance, another aspect gets overlooked: the business brand. At the end of the day, every hospital is a business. Keeping a brand\u2019s message visible and consistent is just another way a hospital answering service can boost business performance.<\/p>\n<p>The ability to stay on message is crucial in building trust with customers. And in the medical world, those customers are patients. In order to build confidence and foster long-term relationships, hospitals need a consistent brand message. One of the best methods for developing a marketable and trustworthy brand is with a hospital call answering platform. From professional scripts to efficient personnel, TeleDirect can help elevate your hospital or healthcare organization brand.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Medicare Provider Contact Center <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>With <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cms.gov\/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems\/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">more than 50 million people<\/a> currently enrolled in Medicare coverage, your hospital needs an effective way to answer coverage questions, track changing legislation and stay on top of premium adjustments \u2013 in many cases, all in a single call!

While that\u2019s still an important component of HIPAA, recent focus has shifted on patient health information. Keeping this data secure yet accessible is a challenge for many hospital call centers.

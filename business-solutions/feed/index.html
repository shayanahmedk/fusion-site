										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>How is Contact Tracing Done? | How Does Contact Tracing Work? | How Do Call Centers Help with Healthcare-Related Communication? | Get Answers with TeleDirect!</h2>
<p>Since the onset of COVID-19 back in early 2020, public health authorities have made efforts to detect, monitor and slow the spread of the disease.</p>
<p>A key part of this process is contact tracing. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control &amp; Prevention (CDC), contact tracing has helped<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/contact-tracing.html#:~:text=The%20public%20health%20worker%20will,help%20you%20isolate%20or%20quarantine." target="_blank" rel="noopener"> slow the spread of the virus</a>.</p>
<p>What is contact tracing, and how is contact tracing done? Most people are vaguely aware of contact tracing, and<a href="https://www.teledirect.com/"> TeleDirect’s</a> call center professionals, which help spearhead one of the<a href="https://www.teledirect.com/industries/healthcare/"> premier healthcare call center platforms</a> available anywhere, put together this quick reference to answer any questions you have.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What is Contact Tracing?</h2>
<p>How does contact tracing work? Simply put, contact tracing is the process of analyzing, identifying and tracking any people who have come in contact with an infected person.</p>
<p>This process involves both<a href="https://www.teledirect.com/services/inbound/"> inbound</a> &amp;<a href="https://www.teledirect.com/services/outbound/"> outbound</a> communication, with collaboration between health authorities and the general public. As you might expect, medical establishments with fully capable, reliable contact centers have been able to conduct contact tracing activities much more efficiently than those without one.</p>
<p>TeleDirect’s<a href="https://www.teledirect.com/services/inbound/hotline-call-center/"> hotline call center</a> is also a useful tool to handle critical, time-sensitive communication between patients and healthcare providers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>How Is Contact Tracing Done?</h2>
<p>How does contact tracing actually work? Here’s a general overview of the procedure:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">The index case of COVID-19 is identified when the patient notifies health authorities.</li>
<li aria-level="1">This person is asked questions about their recent whereabouts, recent contacts, etc.</li>
<li aria-level="1">People who have come into contact with the index case are contacted and asked further questions.</li>
<li aria-level="1">The index case and any close contacts are given counsel, treatment advice, screening, etc.</li>
<li aria-level="1">If required, the index case and any close associates are advised to quarantine or limit their public appearances.</li>
<li aria-level="1">All data is logged in public health databases for a comprehensive picture of the disease’s spread (cities, towns, townships, states, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Tools like<a href="https://www.teledirect.com/services/outbound/surveys-and-feedback/"> surveys’ &amp; feedback</a> are critical in piecing together the overall health puzzle associated with any outbreak.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>Need Help With Contact Tracing Tasks? Contact TeleDirect!</b></h2>
<p>A contact center is helpful in identifying everyone associated with contact tracing. Now that you know what contact tracing is, you can see how a call center can assist with this complex process. TeleDirect’s<a href="https://www.teledirect.com/services/outbound/surveys-and-feedback/"> medical call centers</a> protect sensitive patient data and are compliant with all HIPAA regulations and guidelines.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What are your expectations with your own call center? Probably higher than you’d think. Your customer contact center requires next-gen technology, reliable infrastructure, professionally trained agents, and the flexibility to adapt with – and stay ahead of – an ever-evolving business environment.</p>
<p>At times, there’s a disconnect between call center expectations and call center performance. Keep them separate long enough, and your customers will eventually seek out other companies. Keep call center expectations and call center performance aligned and in focus, and it’s much easier to stay on top of key customer service metrics and indicators.</p>
<p>That’s why many companies choose <a href="https://www.teledirect.com/">TeleDirect</a> for their business process outsourcing (BPO) call center solution. The resources, time, and money required to meet your own demanding standards often override realistic projections, which in turn negatively impacts employee morale and your bottom line.</p>
<p>In short, your call center expectations are high – and TeleDirect’s <a href="https://www.teledirect.com/services/call-center-platform/">proven call center platform</a> meets and exceeds those projectionson a daily basis.</p>
<p>Likewise, your customers (both potential and already paying) demand top-flight performance from your contact center. Expectations increase all the time, despite considerable time constraints, ultra-competitive marketplaces, and round-the-clock communication.</p>
<p>But what exactly do your customers want from your call center? TeleDirect’s contact center consultants view this question from a unique, dual-tier perspective, with a clear focus on call center customer expectations:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Our own client expectations (yours)</li>
<li aria-level="1">Your client’s expectations</li>
</ul>
<p>We know what it takes to meet and exceed your expectations. In turn, we can shed light on what your clients are looking for when they interact with your own contact center.</p>

<p>It seems that many forms of communication are becoming increasingly impersonal. Automated. Robotic. Too “futuristic.” One way your call center meets customer expectations is providing prompt, efficient service combined with a personal touch of friendly live agent interaction.</p>
<p>It’s certainly a fine line to straddle. Yet your customers expect you to navigate it without fault. With high expectations comes little or no room for error. Avoiding those obvious mishaps while continuously improving your call center is just one customer expectation. Here are a few more:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Prompt, professional service</b>. Call center expectations are partly based on what your clients want, and what kind of service they’ve already received. . A call center is a forum where your clients demand nothing but the most efficient, on-the-mark excellence. Your customers expect an immediate response. Getting put on hold is another way of saying, “your problems aren’t that important to us.” TeleDirect’s <a href="https://www.teledirect.com/services/call-center-platform/">call center platform</a>, responsive scripts and advanced automation bolster your ability to meet the most demanding customer expectations.</li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Master crisis mode</b>. For some incoming calls – product recalls, to name just one example – your clients want nothing less than to be reassured 110%. If your products or services cause issues with customer service, it’s your call center’s duty to clean up the initial mess. Thanks to our robust <a href="https://www.teledirect.com/services/inbound/">inbound communication</a> protocols – totally customizable for your requirements – we’ll ensure any crisis is turned around with your outsourced call center.</li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Provide useful outreach</b>. Your call center isn’t exclusively an inbound solution – or at least, it shouldn’t be. Your clients expect a certain level of attention from you as well, which means your <a href="https://www.teledirect.com/services/outbound/">outbound solutions</a> (lead generation, appointment follow-ups &amp; confirmations, scheduled callbacks, telesales, and more) require outstanding performance at all times. Give your customers the attention they deserve with a smart, solution-oriented outreach plan, and consider those expectations met!</li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>The chance to offer feedback</b>. If your call center is doing its job, some clients want to acknowledge great service. The same holds true for improvement opportunities; if your contact platform needs a tweak, feedback is critical. This is where call center customer expectations become valuable data points for your contact center. Your clients expect to be part of the conversation, to know they’re integral to the entire customer relationship process. <a href="https://www.teledirect.com/services/outbound/surveys-and-feedback/">Surveys and feedback</a> are just a few important elements of TeleDirect’s outbound services.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><b>Benefits of Telehealth </b><b>| Pros &amp; Cons | Client &amp; Provider Perspectives | How TeleDirect Can Help Improve Your Telehealth Platform</b></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the COVID-19 pandemic taught us anything – besides the importance of personal health – it’s that face-to-face communication has been redefined…forever.</p>
<p>Long before the COVID global health crisis, everything from work meetings to family get-togethers was trending remote, thanks to technology like FaceTime, teleconferences, and other telecommunication platforms.</p>
<p>And your doctor’s office isn’t – well, immune – from these trends. Telehealth services are bigger than ever. And the telehealth vs in person debate isn’t going away anytime soon.</p>
<p>What are the benefits of telehealth? What are the basics on how to use telehealth services? And given the challenges and benefits of telehealth platforms, how can you ensure optimal communication between <a href="https://www.antino.com/blog/cloud-computing-in-healthcare/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">healthcare</a> provider and patient, no matter where you’re at on the healthcare continuum?</p>
<p>All great questions – and TeleDirect has the answers!<a href="https://www.teledirect.com/"> TeleDirect</a> offers complete business process outsourcing (BPO) plans for healthcare organizations across the globe, including an ever-increasing share of the worldwide telehealth marketplace. Our versatile, ready-to-deploy <a href="https://www.teledirect.com/services/call-center-platform/"> call center platform</a>, along with other communication resources, provides a comprehensive support system for any telehealth service.</p>
<p>Whether you’re a patient or provider, keep reading to learn more on how to use telehealth, telehealth benefits and challenges and more!</p>
<h2><b>The Basics: </b><b>Telehealth Meaning</b><b>, </b><b>Benefits of Telehealth </b><b>&amp; More</b></h2>
<p>The simplest definition of telehealth is essentially the presentation and distribution of medical information from anywhere in the world. Medical checkups, prescriptions, review of personal patient info like x-rays, general<a href="https://www.teledirect.com/industries/healthcare/"> healthcare updates</a> related to patient care…you get the idea.</p>
<p>What do patients need to know about how to use telehealth? The tools are simple – a secure internet connection and working webcam at the bare minimum. Some healthcare organizations will use popular videoconferencing apps like Zoom, or proprietary applications to further enhance protections and data security to meet<a href="https://www.teledirect.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/HIPAA_Security_Rule_Standard.pdf"> HIPAA requirements</a>.</p>
<p>Since the technology is new, there are plenty of telehealth benefits and challenges to consider. On the positive side, the pure convenience of telehealth is hard to beat. Plus, telehealth helps limit the costs associated with in person visits. One of the obvious benefits of telehealth is the remote configuration, which helps keep vulnerable patients protected from infectious diseases away from home.</p>
<p>However, there are a few hurdles the healthcare community is still working through with telehealth. For one, how do telehealth services align with traditional<a href="https://www.teledirect.com/services/inbound/reservation-services/"> reservations</a>? Given staffing shortages,<a href="https://www.teledirect.com/services/outbound/"> outbound communication</a> is more important than ever to keep patients engaged and properly informed.

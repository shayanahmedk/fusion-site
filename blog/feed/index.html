										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyone who has been in customer service understands that the human connection is impossible to replace. At TeleDirect, we consider our agents the backbone of our company. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s how</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> we’ve gone from an eight-chair answering service to a national business process outsourcer. </span><a href="https://www.teledirect.com/blog/ai-to-replace-call-center-agents/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AI call center</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> technology, however, has made significant inroads into the industry. While, in our opinion, it can never replace live agents, </span><a href="https://www.teledirect.com/blog/automated-answering-service-vs-live-call-agent/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">call center AI</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> offers remarkable advancements that can transform the experience for customers and business owners. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From machine learning to natural language processing, it understands the spoken </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">word. The</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> more it listens, the more it learns. It analyzes and processes vast amounts of data, enabling it to excel at data-driven tasks and data-based decisions. These abilities provide call centers with tremendous opportunities to improve customer support. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the time it takes an agent to find one answer to a technical question, </span><a href="https://www.teledirect.com/services/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">artificial intelligence call center</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> technology has scanned through the manual. It can direct the agent to each step required to resolve the customer&#8217;s pain point. Thank you, AI. What it can&#8217;t do is empathize. Well, it can sound like it&#8217;s empathizing. It certainly knows all the phrases humans use when displaying compassion. Unfortunately, your customer at the other end of the line knows that the virtual assistant is heartless and void of genuine concern.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.semrush.com/blog/artificial-intelligence-stats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Semrush</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reports that 40% of marketing and sales departments prioritize machine learning and AI technology. You may wonder what that has to do with a call center. At TeleDirect, we&#8217;re an extension of your team, and our team is extensively trained in </span><a href="https://www.teledirect.com/services/outbound/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">upselling and lead generation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We connect with qualified leads and new sales opportunities using</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> CRM data analysis. It&#8217;s a brave new world we live in, and AI has the opportunity to transform it.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understanding Call Center AI </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To understand </span><a href="https://www.teledirect.com/blog/5-reasons-to-hire-a-call-center-service/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AI for call center</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> uses and </span><a href="https://www.teledirect.com/services/contact-center-services/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">how artificial intelligence is transforming contact centers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we must first explore the darker side. Some agencies are replacing call agents with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">AI-powered</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> virtual agents. Others are using </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">artificial intelligence</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to scan large amounts of information and conversations and then telling agents what to say and the exact words to use when speaking with a customer. And, if they don’t? They’re penalized. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the darker side of AI, akin to the latest dramas in which AI becomes the boss, and humans </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the assistants.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The brighter side of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">AI call center</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> technology is its ability to automate repetitive tasks through robotic process automation. Filling out forms, record keeping and data entry are in its wheelhouse, giving call agents more time to focus on customer service and resolving complex questions or grievances. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> just the tip of the iceberg of the many benefits AI brings to call centers.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">6 Ways AI Benefits Call Centers</span></h2>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Routing to the Appropriate Agent </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Streamlining workflow improves efficiency, productivity and communication, three essential elements of a successful call center. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Artificial intelligence call center</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> technology may answer phones, find out why a person is calling and then direct them to the appropriate agent with the answers they seek. This agent </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">might</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> be better suited for product knowledge or customer complaint resolutions. It even considers personalities. That&#8217;s a much better experience than being continually routed to different people in search of someone who can help.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Generates Powerful Insights </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AI for call centers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can analyze data that includes written and spoken comments. As they speak with a customer, call agents receive AI’s insights. Using their human insights, the agent can determine the best course of action, providing faster and exceptional customer service. AI can also create customer profiles based on past experiences, conversations and orders. These profiles enable agents to upsell and offer greater value and a better experience.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Access Information Quickly</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of AI&#8217;s best traits is its ability to access information quickly. It can collect data from separate systems and unify it for meaningful connections. It can search databases and find answers to challenging questions. Is your customer experiencing a technical glitch? AI can help agents find the needed steps to resolve the malfunction or user error almost instantly.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Help Call Agents Make Decisions</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As humans, we may not sleep well one night, or an event in our lives may leave us off balance. In other words, we’re not always perfect or at our best. Fortunately, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">AI call center</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> technology is. While call center agents don’t want to be superseded and placed in the passenger seat, they appreciate AI’s support. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, a customer calls wondering which product suits their needs best. In the time an agent researches the possibilities, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">call center AI</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has come up with the answer. It may even recommend additional or different products that cater to their objectives. Can call agents do that as well? Absolutely. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> AI saved some time </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in this instance</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which your customers always appreciate. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Determining Customer Sentiment</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AI can also use its powers for sentiment analysis. This gives it the remarkable ability to analyze what words are used, a customer&#8217;s tone of voice and their cadence or the rhythms in their speech patterns. This analysis determines what a customer genuinely wants and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">whether the conversation provides</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it. This information enables call agents to switch gears or direct the conversation accordingly, increasing customer satisfaction. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speed Up Interactions</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks to technological input, fast customer service is expected. Prioritizing customers’ questions and orders promotes trust in your brand and, ultimately, brand loyalty. Speeding up response times and personalizing service are benefits of integrating artificial intelligence.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How TeleDirect Can Help Achieve Customer Success </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Will call centers be fully automated one day? For some, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">answer is probably yes. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">at TeleDirect, real people, our trusted and trained call agents, respond to your clients with understanding, empathy and direct knowledge. In addition to </span><a href="https://www.teledirect.com/services/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">call center services</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, they provide reservations, order processing and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tier 1</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> tech support. While </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">AI call center</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> technology can prompt fast resolutions, it’s our agents that enhance the customer experience while providing additional revenue and lead </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">generation</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for our clients. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Call center AI</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can support agents, but human interactions build brand loyalty and ensure customer retention. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ve </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">likely </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">experienced the difference between a customer service call that left you satisfied and one that resulted in gritted teeth. What was the difference? One person was probably professional, friendly, courteous and knowledgeable. The other may have left you with unanswered questions, the sour taste of frequent interruptions and more questions than resolutions. We’ve all seen the good, the bad and the ugly as it relates to business phone etiquette.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> where a </span><a href="https://www.teledirect.com/services/inbound/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">customer service script</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> comes </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">into play</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Call handling scripts</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> outline the customer&#8217;s journey and prompt the person representing your company to create a memorable and consistent interaction with a client, customer or business associate. They are not word-for-word robotic catchphrases. They assure that every caller will be greeted and spoken to professionally, consistent with your brand&#8217;s voice and image.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="https://www.teledirect.com/services/inbound/customer-service/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">phone call script</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> consists of guidelines specific to the person calling your company. They contain the preferred language and answers to commonly asked questions. They provide questions to ask customers that will help resolve any issues or increase leads and opportunities. A </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">business call script</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is designed to provide the best customer service, instilling a sense that you care for your customers and can efficiently provide answers and solutions.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Role of a Customer Service Script</span></h2>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Balancing Empathy and Efficiency</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to </span><a href="https://www.zippia.com/advice/customer-service-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zippia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, 94% of customers feel that customer service influences their purchases and brand choices. The </span><a href="https://www.theacsi.org/the-acsi-difference/top-10-acsi-companies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">America Customer Satisfaction Index</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (ACSI) </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">correlates directly with</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> customer satisfaction and corporate profits. Companies with the top ACSI scores include Chewy, Chick-fil-A and Amazon. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, what are today’s customers </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">expecting</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">? Over 80% expect to reach someone immediately when contacting a business. They want efficiency, consistent interactions across all departments and resolution. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">While</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> product knowledge is critical, one of the most important skills is empathy. Empathizing with customers requires patience, understanding and active listening. It lets customers know you have their back and develops an authentic connection. Without that experience, even the most loyal customers will transition to a competitor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="https://www.teledirect.com/blog/10-must-have-skill-set-for-call-center-agent-teams/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">customer service call script</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> helps call agents and employees meet today’s consumer preferences. It teaches them </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">key phrases</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that build rapport through empathy and efficiency. Phrases like “I hear you” and “I understand what you’re looking for or the issues you face” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">let</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> customers know they’re being listened to and are speaking with someone </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">who can empathize with them</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key Ingredients of a Successful Script</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A successful </span><a href="https://www.teledirect.com/blog/call-center-script-vs-call-flow/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">call center script</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> contains these main elements:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>The Greeting:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> We know it sounds like a no-brainer, but you would be surprised at the difference these few words make to customer satisfaction. One simple example, “Thank you for calling (name of company). This is (name). How may I help you?” spoken in a cheerful tone sets the stage for a successful exchange. Then, make sure to learn the customer’s name and repeat it.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Flow Charts:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> These charts start with the various reasons someone calls. Examples include someone who calls to place an order, ask for more information, set an appointment or register a complaint. Determine the appropriate messaging for each customer, including proper questions and answers to common questions.                                                                                                                   </span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mistakes </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Avoid in Script Creation</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In today&#8217;s AI world, one of the most common mistakes business owners make when delving into a </span><a href="https://www.teledirect.com/blog/knowledge-base-for-customer-support-why-do-you-need-it/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">customer support script</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is believing automation and menus can take it from there. Yes, AI is smart, but lacks the human touch and empathy. Hearing an automated response is far different than personalized service.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another mistake is creating a generalized </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">phone call script</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Nothing irritates a customer more than feeling like they are not being heard and the person at the other end of the phone is simply reading a standardized message. At TeleDirect, we dig deep to determine the most important information to include in your </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">call center script</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Consider them guidebooks that help employees and call agents provide accurate, reliable information to your customers.</span></p>
<p><b>That&#8217;s not all. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">A study conducted by </span><a href="https://hbr.org/2016/07/what-great-listeners-actually-do" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harvard Business Review</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found that people perceive best listeners as those who periodically ask good questions. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Personalization: Why </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">One Size</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Doesn’t Fit All</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A successful </span><a href="https://www.teledirect.com/blog/why-excellent-customer-call-back-service-matters-for-your-business/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">phone script for business</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> needs different scenarios directed toward the types of calls you receive. For instance, are most customer calls related to purchases, troubleshooting or making appointments or reservations? Each of these callers requires a different </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">customer service script</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Determine the most common calls and create a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">business phone script</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> unique to each situation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you get calls from business associates and investors? While these calls are typically transferred, or the recipient takes a message, that initial greeting and the tone it invokes</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> illustrate </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">your priorities. An upbeat tone of voice may reflect interest and empathy, while a monotone demonstrates disinterest and boredom. The 7-38-55 rule suggests </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">tone of voice makes up 38% of all communications.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Always keep in mind that a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">customer service script</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is an outline. Employees and call agents must be trained to follow the flow but react with real-time language. It&#8217;s easy to discern someone reading words versus speaking from the heart. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Measuring the Impact: Feedback and Adjustments</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Working with a company that provides feedback and facts is the only way to tell if your </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">phone call script</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is working and if you’ve created a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">good</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">customer service script</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. At TeleDirect, one of our benchmarks is a dedicated client call quality assurance score. We also measure the average speed to answer and how long our call agents are on the line with your customers. We ensure they’re using the proper </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">call center script</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and your customers are happy with their support. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At TeleDirect, we&#8217;re proud of our personalized, friendly call agents. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They receive extensive training and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">become an extension of your team. We’ll ask the right questions and then help you prepare a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">customer service script</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ideal for your brand, industry and clients. Then, by collecting data, we’ll work to improve your scripts and ensure they’re providing the best customer service experience possible. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VoIP, or Voice over Internet Protocol, allows you to make calls over the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">internet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This technology went mainstream in the early 2000s and has steadily gained traction in the business sector. With the advent of the remote workforce, which doesn&#8217;t appear to be going away any time soon, VoIP became a standard, resolving many pain points while reducing costs. According to </span><a href="https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/8924-voip-for-business.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business News Daily</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, over one-third of businesses use a </span><a href="https://www.teledirect.com/services/inbound/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">VoIP phone</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> system </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">today</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this comprehensive guide, we&#8217;ll explore the technology behind these systems and the features they bring to the table. Discover if a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">VoIP phone line</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is right for your business and how our team at TeleDirect uses this technology to enhance customer service. If you&#8217;re wondering, “</span><a href="https://www.teledirect.com/blog/effective-inbound-call-strategy/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is VoIP, and how does it work</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">?” read on.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Is a VoIP Phone?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VoIP phones</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are designed to use VoIP technology to place and receive calls over an IP network. Because they use the internet, you no longer need to run copper wires for regular landlines or make calls via a mobile network. An added benefit is that your employees are no longer fixed to their desks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These phones work anywhere, whether in a boardroom, at an off-site meeting or from home. If you have a high-speed internet connection, you can use VoIP. Have you used Google Voice or Skype? Then, you&#8217;ve used VoIP.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Are the Types of VoIP Phones?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are three basic types of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">VoIP phones</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. One is a hardware-based VoIP desk phone and is much like traditional phones. They include a caller ID display, a touchpad and a microphone or speakerphone. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The other involves installing software on the user&#8217;s mobile device or computer. The interface may include a caller ID display and touchpad. Headsets </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">might </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be required. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both phone types offer similar features, including call conferencing, call transfer and voicemail. In addition to these standard features, many offer text messaging, team chat, video calling, auto attendant, call waiting, call analytics and call recording. You can get multiple phone numbers and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">quickly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> route calls. Some even integrate with CRM software. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can also use existing landlines by retrofitting your analog phones with an adapter.    </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How Does VoIP Phone Technology Work?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you use VoIP, your voice converts into a digital signal so it can be sent over the internet. It&#8217;s then reverted into an analog signal by the phone at the other end. Advancements in technology make this conversion effortless, with no special equipment required.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You do need to subscribe to a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">VoIP phone</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> system provider. These providers offer VoIP services, such as compatible devices and software. They&#8217;re responsible for connecting the calls to other telephone networks.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Benefits of VoIP Call Center Solutions</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Businesses and call centers are switching over to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">VoIP phones</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for several reasons. The following represent a few of their many benefits.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Improved Call Quality</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.teledirect.com/blog/the-cost-of-a-missed-call/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wireless VoIP phone</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> systems are capable of high-definition voice. This technology improves the quality over traditional landlines, making it clearer and more natural. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reduced Costs</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VoIP phone</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> users save money in multiple ways. You no longer need telephone service, saving on long-distance charges. Most </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">wireless VoIP phone</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> service providers also offer unlimited domestic calling. You don’t require an </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">on-site</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> private branch exchange that creates the telephone networks that manage calls. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That means no copper phone lines or telephony switches and reduced costs for expansions and upgrades. And, like </span><a href="https://www.teledirect.com/services/inbound/tier-1-tech-support/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">VoIP call center solutions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you can use the existing internet infrastructure. At TeleDirect, we always pass on cost savings to our customers.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scalability</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scalability is critical to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the success of a business</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It ensures you&#8217;re not held back by structure and can continue to expand your company without investing </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> extensive resources. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">VoIP phone requirements</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> don’t include upgraded hardware or new phone lines.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Secure Cloud Storage</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Continually updated, secure data storage centers host sensitive customer data. At TeleDirect, we utilize enterprise-class network security measures, high-level encryption and authentication protocols. Best security practices ensure your information and your client&#8217;s data </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> safe. Comparatively, landline phones route calls through the unencrypted public switched telephone network.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">An Online Management System</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Working as </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">VoIP call center solutions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> means we manage the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">VoIP phone</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> system from an online dashboard. This interface lets our staff easily add phone numbers and contacts and manage permissions, ensuring the right people are connected at the right time. You can also easily add team members and quickly install the app on their existing mobile devices, getting them up and running in minutes.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flexibility</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ability to use this system anywhere gives your staff the communication solutions they need in our current work environment. From salespeople who spend significant time away from the office to today’s remote worker </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">who</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> spends two or more days at home, a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">VoIP phone</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> provides the obvious solution.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you wonder what happens if there&#8217;s a power outage? The answer is a battery backup system for the internet router. Because calls seamlessly transfer from desk phones or </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">computers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to mobile </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">devices</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, team members can switch to their mobile devices should an outage occur. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unified Communications</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unified communications let us meet your clients where they live. Some prefer text messaging, instant messaging, email or voice. Interacting with them in their preferred method ensures better and more reliable communications.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reporting and Monitoring Tools </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our team at TeleDirect ensures the best customer service and support by continually improving call quality and identifying how to best serve your clients. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">VoIP call center solutions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can monitor the average time to answer and call times. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">integrating with a CRM, we can </span><a href="https://www.teledirect.com/blog/10-outbound-call-center-metrics-and-kpis-to-measure/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">monitor key KPIs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, like how many times a customer called about a product or service, letting us optimize promising leads. Our </span><a href="https://www.teledirect.com/services/inbound/customer-service/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">highly trained agents</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> gain immediate access to a customer’s purchase history, enabling them to personalize every call and increase brand loyalty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you&#8217;re thinking about VoIP services for your business, one of the most important considerations is whether you have enough bandwidth and if your network can support it. Once that’s in place, you possess a scalable, secure phone service ideal for today&#8217;s on-the-go workforce.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At TeleDirect, we take advantage of the many features </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">VoIP call center solutions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> offer to provide our clients with the best service possible. From improving performance and productivity to using analytics to increase lead conversions and customer satisfaction, we’re dedicated to improving your customers’ experience.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taking</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> some of the countless responsibilities off you and your employees can free up internal resources. Instead of rushing to answer phones at all hours, your team can focus on providing the best products and services that define your brand. Knowing this, you may do a quick search for call services and contact the first one on the list. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> there is a significant difference between a call center that provides the same service to every client and one that tailors </span><a href="https://www.teledirect.com/services/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">outsourced</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> customer support</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several business segments can benefit from </span><a href="https://www.teledirect.com/blog/call-center-metrics-and-kpis-how-to-measure-call-center-performance/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">customer support outsourcing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><a href="https://www.teledirect.com/services/inbound/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inbound</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.teledirect.com/services/outbound/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">outbound call center</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> services provide personalized and professional customer engagement. They answer questions, engage callers, process orders and take reservations. They follow up with targeted messages, make appointments, convert new leads, close deals and provide market research. Essentially, they are a part of your team and an extension of your brand. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But you may only need some of these services in your present growth phase. Eventually, as your business expands, so will your needs. Business scaling refers to growing your business intelligently and efficiently in a manner where you increase profits and your gains outweigh your losses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A professional </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">outsource customer support</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> team will assess your needs and determine the options that make the most sense to your business structure and goals. They help you select the best way they can support your growth, scale efficiency and streamline operations. It&#8217;s all about ROI optimization.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best part is that this</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> customization can maintain or lower costs while adding revenue.  </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why Operational Efficiency Matters in Customer Support Outsourcing</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Companies are always </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">looking</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for changes they can make that will optimize their operations and reduce costs while staying ahead of the competition. One way to achieve this enhanced operational efficiency is by freeing up your staff and leveraging the expertise of extensively trained agents. Now, everyone is using their talents to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">their</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> fullest </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">potential</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enhancing Customer Experiences: The Secret Sauce to Business Growth</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/blakemorgan/2019/09/24/50-stats-that-prove-the-value-of-customer-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forbes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, 84% of businesses that improve customers’ experiences report increased revenue. While the products or services you provide are the calling card, the positive customer experience ensures they return. Nurturing these relationships reduces customer churn and encourages repeat purchases. Not only do satisfied customers come back, but they also tell their friends, write reviews and share their experiences on social media. So, how do you enhance the customer experience? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In today&#8217;s world, personalization, authenticity and enhanced communications are key. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">done correctly, that can take a lot of time. </span><a href="https://www.teledirect.com/services/inbound/customer-service/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outsourcing customer service</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> enables you to provide the best customer experience without hiring, training and supervising a whole department or several employees. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you grow, your customer service needs grow as well. When you </span><a href="https://www.teledirect.com/blog/12-essential-call-center-customer-service-tips-to-deliver-a-first-class-experience/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">outsource customer service</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you provide your customers with the best possible service at a significantly reduced price.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scalability: The Unsung Hero of Outsourcing</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Relying on internal customer service solutions requires reacting quickly to changes in demand. Let&#8217;s say you hit the jackpot, and a product went viral overnight. It happens. Now, you&#8217;re scrambling, spending time and energy hiring and training personnel to continue the upward momentum with excellent customer service. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unless, of course, you&#8217;re already working with a trusted </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">customer support outsourcing</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> team. Then, you simply reach out and explain the situation. At TeleDirect, we may even know you&#8217;ve gone viral before you do. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An experienced customer service outsourcing company should be agile enough to scale operations and provide the additional customer service and support you require. The same is true during a slowdown, such as holidays or seasonal changes. During slower periods, you can scale back, saving money while you prepare for the busy season that lies ahead. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to Choose the Right Outsourcing Partner</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first step is learning what they offer. Do they provide inbound and outbound call services, and do they have the ability to scale upon demand? Are their agents extensively trained and vetted, ensuring the voice of your brand aligns with your vision? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your business operates in the United States, you might want your representatives to be U.S.-based, too.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Can they offer 24/7 </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">customer support outsourcing</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">? In today’s global economy, it’s essential to be there for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">your</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">clients, regardless of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> their time zone. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since they might </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be handling your clients&#8217; data, it’s important to ask about their security standards and the level of reliability and redundancy. The key is finding </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">outsourcing customer support</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that aligns with your team, fits your brand and provides in-depth </span><a href="https://www.teledirect.com/blog/call-center-quality-assurance-why-is-it-important-in-call-centers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">quality assurance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Integrating Outsource Customer Service: Steps for a Seamless Transition</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At TeleDirect, we start the integration process with an overall assessment. We explore where interruptions in service or deficiencies exist and analyze where and how </span><a href="https://www.teledirect.com/services/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">outsourced customer support</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can help. We’ll go over strategic customization with the goal of scaling efficiency and growing your business. Are you experiencing funnel drop-offs, and is your conversion rate where it should be? Are customers placed on hold, or worse, are calls going straight to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">voicemail</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Could you use more </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tier 1</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> tech support? This is a game changer in terms of satisfied customers. When we start working with a company and seeing their pain points and how we can help resolve them, we often hear an audible </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">sigh</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of relief and the question, “But I thought you were a call center?” At TeleDirect, we&#8217;ve spent over 25 years supporting our clients and, along the way, learning what we can do to help them thrive. Today, we have the support strategies and </span><a href="https://www.teledirect.com/services/inbound/tier-1-tech-support/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">customer service outsourcing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for every business problem that comes your way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you’re ready, we integrate a cloud telephony platform and our professional U.S.-based agents. The mobile platform lets you see every activity, including immediate call result visibility.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At TeleDirect, we ensure a seamless transition and exceptional customer service and sales. You&#8217;ll wonder why you didn’t call sooner. To develop a tailored solution and a professional </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">outsource customer support</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> team, call (800) 776-1081 and get started today. </span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Toll-Free</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Phone Number?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What phone number do you offer customers and leads to contact your business? If it is not a </span><a href="https://www.teledirect.com/services/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">toll-free number,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you might be letting valuable customers slip away, as well as seriously inconveniencing the ones who do call. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Toll” is another word for a monetary fee. Some phone numbers charge callers a toll when they are dialed — even if nobody answers. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Toll-free numbers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> do not </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">charge a fee</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. As the name implies, </span><a href="https://www.teledirect.com/blog/855-area-code-everything-you-need-to-know-about-toll-free-numbers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">toll-free </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">telephone</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> numbers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> do not incur any charges </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">for</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> calls from landlines or </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">cellphones </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">with “unlimited calling” plans. This is true regardless of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the state or city from which they are dialing</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Instead, the company covers any costs incurred on the call. This is an investment most businesses are happy to make since it provides an impressive ROI.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many businesses choose to</span><a href="https://www.teledirect.com/services/outbound/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">buy toll-free number</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> services for their contact center, and you can, too. In this article, we will discuss why a toll-free number can improve your businessa and offer helpful suggestions for setting one up. If you have any more questions, please contact the TeleDirect team.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buy Toll-Free Number</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Services?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Customer experience matters to your bottom line — and a </span><a href="https://www.teledirect.com/services/inbound/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1-800 number for business</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will help you deliver the best. Here are a few reasons why:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">It Expands Your Reach</span></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We live in a global society. Thanks to modern technology, you might have leads and potential customers across the country. With a toll-free number, anyone in the country can call you, regardless of the city or state where they live. This allows you to reach more customers.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">It Helps Serve Customers </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Around</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the Clock</span></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">toll-free business number</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can be directed to a TeleDirect call center so that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">true customer service professionals can handle every call you receive</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Our inbound and outbound call centers have options to function 24/7, so you can serve every time zone, all day, every day.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">It Builds Trust and Brand Loyalty</span></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your clients have an important question or urgent problem to address. They don’t want to be charged money simply for trying to contact you. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Customers </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">may switch to another brand and advise others to avoid your company </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">when this happens</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">can be</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> avoided by providing your customers with the courtesy of a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">toll-free number</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to call.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">It Increases Your ROI</span></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a toll-free number, more people can access your business. This is huge! By allowing more people to access your contact center and speak with your team, you can open your company to a bigger client base, more sales and a bigger ROI.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Toll-Free Business Number</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Types</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Toll-free numbers all begin with a three-digit number, starting with eight. There are several different </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">toll-free business number</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> variations: 800, 833, 844, 855, 866, 877 and 888. This allows for more numerical combinations and options for businesses to have toll-free numbers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some brands choose to use a “vanity” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">toll-free number.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> These are phone numbers where the digits also spell a word, usually related to your industry, like 800-BUBBLES for a spa or hot tub company or 800-GIGGLES for a chain of comedy clubs. A famous example of a vanity number is 1-800-FLOWERS: that’s also their brand name!</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to Get a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Toll-Free Number for Business</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Purposes</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ready for your </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">toll-free number for business?</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Toll-free numbers are assigned by the Federal Communications Commission</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (FCC), </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and it is done </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">at</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> random. To get a toll-free number for your business, you can contact a “respectable organization,” often </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">called</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a RespOrg. RespOrgs are companies that reserve and distribute toll-free phone numbers to businesses across the country. They are certified by Somos </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inc.,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the company </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">that</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> manages the overall database of toll-free numbers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The FCC also developed the 833 Auction, which allows companies to “bid” for an 833 number.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Want to know more about your outbound call center performance? Metrics and KPI tracking will help you do this with ease. Measuring and examining your <a href="https://www.teledirect.com/blog/call-center-metrics-and-kpis-how-to-measure-call-center-performance/">call center metrics</a> and KPIs (key performance indicators) will provide valuable information about your outbound call center’s performance and identify any weak spots. This data will help you make necessary improvements and help give a better outbound customer service experience to your clients and leads.</p>
<p>At TeleDirect, we know you <a href="https://www.teledirect.com/value-results/">value results</a> — and we have the outbound call center KPI knowledge to make sure you get there. Read on to learn more about the key metrics and KPIs businesses should consider with their outbound call centers. If you come away with any lingering questions, get in touch with our team. We love a good phone call.</p>
<h2>Key Metrics and KPIs for Outbound Call Centers</h2>
<p>Metrics and KPIs measure a facet of a company’s performance — in this case, their outbound call center. This is measured by setting and communicating specific goals — generally called “targets” or “indicators.” These targets and indicators will be different depending on the industry and business. Call and contact centers tend to focus on customer satisfaction and agent performance.</p>
<h3>Customer Satisfaction Metrics and KPIs</h3>
<p>Customer satisfaction metrics and KPIs revolve around the experience that consumers have with your company. In the case of an outbound call center, it refers to the customer&#8217;s experience when they are on the receiving end of contact from your business. This includes things like cold calls, fundraising, callbacks or follow-ups.</p>
<p>Some typical customer satisfaction KPIs for an outbound call center include:</p>
<h4>Average Handle Time</h4>
<p>This measures, on average, how long your customers are on the line with your agents. Ideally, your customer service calls will last under a certain length, though the ideal call length varies depending on the industry and product.</p>
<h4>Customer Effort Score (CES)</h4>
<p>Are your customers satisfied? CES is often determined by satisfaction surveys, and explains how easily your outgoing agents met your customers’ needs.</p>
<h4>Average Call Length</h4>
<p>This KPI measures the average overall length of an outgoing phone call, including hold times and transfers. As with average handle time, the “right” length will depend on the industry.</p>
<h3>Agent Performance Metrics and KPIs</h3>
<p>These metrics and KPIs measure the performance of your staff — in this case, outbound call center agents. Some agent performance KPIs for an outbound call center include:</p>
<h4>Call Quality</h4>
<p>This assesses how well your agents perform in conversation with customers. Are they polite? Helpful? Do they use the proper scripting and verbiage?</p>
<h4>Calls Per Agent</h4>
<p>This KPI is a way of measuring the productivity levels of your outbound call center agents. It assesses how many outbound calls are made during a shift and whether they are all answered by customers.</p>
<h4>Agent Sales Rate</h4>
<p>How often are your outbound agents closing deals in an average day or week? This KPI measures how well your agents move customers through the proper <a href="https://www.teledirect.com/business-solutions/maximize-your-lead-funnel-to-close-more-sales/">sales funnel</a>.</p>
<h2>Best Practices for Outbound Call Centers</h2>
<p>So, let’s say you’ve been measuring your outbound call center metrics, and the results don’t look promising. We know that feels like a blow, but it will be OK. Thanks to KPI tracking, you’ve identified a problem and can be on the road to fixing it. Several practices help improve overall call center success. We will discuss three of the most crucial below.</p>
<h4>Scripting</h4>
<p>A good agent script can take your outbound call center to new heights. Not only does this allow you to formulate exactly what you want your agents to say, but you can also provide written responses to various questions and comments so the entire call flows efficiently and naturally. You can also personalize your call center experience through scripting. Your outbound agents will speak to customers according to your unique verbiage, providing a more immersive brand experience.</p>
<h4>Call Monitoring</h4>
<p>Ever called a company and consented to your call being recorded for quality or training purposes? That’s to help measure call quality KPIs. By monitoring your outgoing calls, you can see where your agents are communicating well and where they need improvement.</p>
<h4>Ongoing Training</h4>
<p>In the customer service world, there’s no room for complacency. By continuously training and checking in with your outbound agents, you can ensure they’re providing customer support that aligns with your clientele’s current needs.</p>
<h2>Challenges and Solutions for Outbound Call Centers</h2>
<p>If you’re running your own outbound call center, you may encounter some challenges. Some of the most common issues for an outbound call center include:</p>
<h4>Compliance Issues</h4>
<p>Compliance refers to the legal end of running a business. Occasionally, call centers run into compliance issues relating to security breaches. This can lead to significant customer problems and, in turn, the business. The best solution to this potential challenge is to take a professional route for your outbound call center. Outsourced providers (like TeleDirect) have safeguarding measures to protect sensitive data collected during customer contact.</p>
<h4>Low Answer Rates</h4>
<p>You can’t force folks to answer their phones. Your agents can leave engaging and personalized messages or voicemails when they don’t receive an answer, with clear instructions on how to return the call. A good script will make this straightforward.</p>
<h4>Call Fatigue</h4>
<p>If your staff is exhausted from handling outbound calls on top of their assigned duties, that’s reasonable. They’re doing two jobs at once! It’s time to outsource your outbound call center so they can focus on their hired responsibilities, not customer service or sales. The TeleDirect team can help you build your call center today. Simply call (800) 776-1081 today to get started.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Are you struggling to know the difference between a contact center and a call center? Let this article guide you through the key differences so that you can make an informed decision for your business needs.</p>
<h2>Contact Center vs. Call Center: Understanding the Key Differences</h2>
<p>If you want to up your customer service game, the key is keeping in contact with your customers. Call center services can do this for you — but you might be able to go even bigger. That’s where a multichannel call and contact center comes in — these services allow for better communication across mediums. It offers better customer service and accessibility for more customers and leads, creating more business.</p>
<p>Are you confused about the difference between a contact center and call center services? Your friends at TeleDirect are here to explain everything you need to know — and how to choose the best option for your brand.</p>
<h3>What is a Contact or Call Center?</h3>
<p>Contact and call centers might be different, but they achieve the same goal: helping a business serve the needs of more customers and leads. Contact and call centers are centralized points where consumers can contact a business if they encounter issues or questions about their product or service. Many also help organize customer-related administrative tasks, like making appointments.</p>
<p>Contact and call centers can be operated by the company it represents or a third-party business specializing in communication and customer support. Many companies outsource their call or contact center to improve customer service without adding pressure to their internal team and deliver more cohesive support.</p>
<h2>Call Center Fundamentals</h2>
<p>A call center is a centralized platform that offers customer communication through the phone. There are several different types of call centers. Some are fully automated, so customers press buttons to hear prerecorded responses. This can be great for some brands, but many businesses, like <a href="https://www.teledirect.com/services/inbound/hotline-call-center/">hotline call centers,</a> tech support, or healthcare services, require real people on the other line. That’s where live, inbound, and outbound agent services come into play. They offer personalized telephone support from real people. At TeleDirect, these live agents are <a href="https://www.teledirect.com/services/24-7-call-center-services/">available 24 hours a day</a> and are trained extensively in your company’s values and branding. It allows you to ensure quality customer support around the clock.</p>
<p>Contact centers are a lot like call centers, but with one big difference: they cover more ground. While call centers offer complete customer support over the phone, contact centers can go further. They include other channels in their services, like web chat, email, and social media DMs. A contact center can also help a business with more complex communication and organizational needs, like appointment management, lead response, and customer experience surveying.</p>
<h2>Key Differences Between Call Centers and Contact Centers</h2>
<p>Outsourcing a BPO call or contact center can be a great option for your business. It helps improve your customer satisfaction levels, which leads to an improved reputation, increased sales, better client retention, and an overall better bottom line. However, choosing between the two services is hard when you do not know their differences.</p>
<p>The key difference between call centers and contact centers is in what they offer. Contact centers provide communication and support services across multiple channels, like telephone, email, web chat, and apps. Call centers offer communication and support services through inbound and outbound telephone coverage. This means that, technically, a call center is a type of contact center.</p>
<h2>Choosing the Right Solution for Your Business</h2>
<p>Unsure about what your business needs? By recognizing that you want to incorporate a great contact center into your current strategy, you are already on the right track to choosing the solution for your unique needs. We recommend that your team gets together and considers the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>
<h3>Who are our customers?</h3>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Your customers’ needs will be different depending on their demographic. For instance, many young people prefer to communicate through text, social media DMs and web-chat services rather than speaking to an agent on the phone. If your brand is mostly targeted at youth consumers, a multichannel contact center might be a better way to serve your client base.</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>
<h3>What do our customers need?</h3>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Don’t ignore feedback. If your customer satisfaction surveys and online reviews consistently indicate a recurring problem, you must address it. Often, these problems come from unsatisfactory communication issues, like being unable to get through to any live support for complex problems or long wait times. Finding these weak spots can help you decide where to incorporate new channels and strategies to support their needs.</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>
<h3>What type of communication is required of our industry/product/service?</h3>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Some industries require more forms of communication than others. A call center might be best for your company if most of your customer communication revolves around simple queries (like checking opening hours). Industries that demand more complex or involved communication may choose a contact center model instead, as it offers more support channels for clients.</p>
<h2>Transitioning from a Call Center to a Contact Center</h2>
<p>Transitioning from a call center to a contact center might sound tricky, but taking the BPO route is super simple. By outsourcing a dedicated <a href="https://www.teledirect.com/services/american-call-center-services/">American contact center service</a> (like TeleDirect), you don’t have to worry about any of the technical details. We take care of those elements for you. Once we have learned about your company, values, and branding, we will become an extension of your business.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Learn why call center quality assurance (QA) is essential for customer satisfaction. Our guide explores identifying improvements and overall benefits.</p>
<h2>Call Center Quality Assurance: Why Is It Important?</h2>
<p>Many companies focus intensely on quality assurance regarding their actual product or service. However, that focus often falls by the wayside when it comes to another important facet of their business — customer service and communication. When companies fail to consider call center QA, they could risk the loss of business and a bad reputation. That is why today, we are covering the topic of quality assurance within a contact center and why it is so important.</p>
<h2>What does a QA do in a call center?</h2>
<p>In a call center setting, quality assurance ensures that everything is working as it should — your customers are reaching agents in a timely manner, receiving appropriate responses and agents are efficiently resolving cases. This benefits everybody involved: your company and your customers. On the consumer end, your leads and clients will receive better support and service and will encourage future patronage. On the other end, your business will enjoy a better reputation through word of mouth, leading to more overall business. You will also find that your efficient practice is more cost- and time-friendly.</p>
<h2>Why Is Quality Assurance Important in Call Centers?</h2>
<p>Call centers are the beating heart of many business operations — and they can make or break a customer experience. Let’s say you run a skating rink that offers birthday parties, and you don’t have a call center. Instead, your team members just answer the phone on-site.</p>
<p>So, your customers come to your rink and have a great time skating the day away. However, when they try to call your business to plan a birthday party, everything changes. The phone rings off the hook, and when they finally get through, it is extremely noisy and hard to hear. Music is playing, kids are laughing and the team member answering the phone keeps being interrupted by customers. The call gets disconnected several times due to other incoming calls. Eventually, that potential customer will give up and book another party venue with less fuss.</p>
<p>You just lost a customer due to poor quality assurance!</p>
<p>That’s why quality assurance is crucial in call centers — customers will feel whiplash if a bad phone call ruins their normally good experience with your brand. But many companies make the mistake of asking their team members to “double up” and take calls as well as perform their hired duties. This is often when scenarios like this happen. That’s why we always recommend outsourcing a separate call center with inbound and <a href="https://www.teledirect.com/services/outbound/">outbound agent services.</a></p>
<h2>Elements of Call Center Quality Assurance</h2>
<p>Call quality assurance can be easier to achieve than you might believe. The key to getting there often comes down to <a href="https://www.teledirect.com/blog/call-center-metrics-and-kpis-how-to-measure-call-center-performance/">metrics and KPIs </a>(key performance indicators). These are measurement systems designed to calculate how well a certain facet of a business is performing. In terms of call quality assurance, these metrics will look at certain aspects of your contact center. Often, this includes targets like average wait time, average call length, or the rate at which cases are resolved within a first-call scenario.</p>
<h2>Implementing Call Center Quality Assurance</h2>
<p>What’s the most crucial step to implementing high call center quality assurance levels? Start by going to the source and getting facts. We recommend working with a dedicated BPO service that can help you measure the success of your KPIs and contact and ensure that your <a href="https://www.teledirect.com/blog/call-center-script-vs-call-flow/">call flow</a> is hitting all the right talking points. Your BPO service will also be able to conduct customized outbound customer satisfaction surveys. These call center QA interview questions will help your brand identify your strengths and weaknesses and can help you optimize your overall strategy.</p>
<h2>Tackling Call Center Quality Assurance Challenges</h2>
<p>Is your call center running into any challenges? You may not be alone. Many companies find that challenges come up with their call center, especially when running it without an expert’s help. We’ve listed a few common problems below and ways to solve them.</p>
<p><b>Problem:</b> Overstretched Agents</p>
<p>Let’s say you run a spa. If your massage therapists and dermatologists are also expected to take phone bookings and answer customer DMs, that will likely not fare well for your quality assurance levels. Instead, your customers with questions and comments are being answered by overstretched, busy employees who do not have the training or job title to offer that type of client support. Things get messy quickly. You will end up with busy lines, missed calls, lengthy resolution times, and unhappy clients.</p>
<p><b>Solution:</b> Outsourcing</p>
<p>The best way to beat this problem is by outsourcing a contact center. At TeleDirect, we offer scalable <a href="https://www.teledirect.com/services/small-business-call-center/">call center services for small businesses</a> as well as large ones, so you’ll have the exact coverage you need when you need it. Your brand will look better for this change, and your employees and customers will benefit.</p>
<p><b>Problem:</b> Limited Resources</p>
<p>There are so many necessary resources for running a successful business — and lacking them can lead to frenzied call centers and disgruntled customers.</p>
<p><b>Solution:</b> Consolidate</p>
<p>We recommend bringing all of your communication services into one cohesive platform. At TeleDirect, we offer <a href="https://www.teledirect.com/services/call-center-platform">complete call solutions</a>, so every last bit of communication is handled by our expert team.

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Learn how to provide great customer service in hospitals and healthcare with our guide. Discover the importance of great customer service and how it can improve healthcare outcomes.</p>
<h2>Importance of Great Customer Service in Healthcare and How to Provide It</h2>
<p>If you are a healthcare worker, you are already aware of the impact communication has on your patients and their loved ones. Whether you are a doctor, nurse, pharmacist, or administrator, healthcare workers know that clear, empathetic communication is crucial. After all, health is a complex, sensitive, and often urgent matter. Poor customer service can lead to miscommunication, mistrust, and traumatic experiences for patients and their families. That’s why customer service in healthcare is so essential.</p>
<p>In this article, we will discuss the impact and importance of customer service in healthcare and how you can provide it to your own patients.</p>
<h2>The Impact of Customer Service in Nursing, Healthcare, and Medicine</h2>
<p>In healthcare, “customers” look very different from e-commerce or banking. These people are, first and foremost, your patients. They are relying on your practice to keep them healthy and safe. As with “traditional” customers, patients must receive clear and considerate communication and support to have a good experience.</p>
<p>When that fails, the implications are much worse than they might be with poor customer service at a grocery store. If a patient receives incorrect or disrespectful “customer service” from their healthcare provider, it can have a harmful impact on your business.</p>
<h3>Bad Customer Service in Healthcare: Examples to Consider</h3>
<p>Let’s say your patient is experiencing strange symptoms and wants blood work done. They try to make an appointment with their doctor, but the line is busy whenever they call. They eventually get through, only to be disconnected. Eventually, they make an appointment. However, weeks pass without any word from the practice about the blood test results. The patient calls the practice, only to be met with the same chaos of engaged lines, dropped calls, and long waits. If the patient has urgent health issues to address, this customer experience prolongs treatment and potentially worsens it.</p>
<p>The practice in this example is not trying to provide poor customer service. However, they are overstretched and lack the necessary tools to provide the service their patients need and deserve.</p>
<h2>How to Provide Great Customer Service for Patients</h2>
<p>You did not hire your doctors and nurses to answer phones or keep track of appointments. You chose them for their expertise and training in the medical field. The same goes for your administrative team. How can they support in-house patients and families when they are constantly answering phones and making follow-up calls?</p>
<p>The key to providing great customer service for patients is quite simple — outsource a medical call center. This allows your healthcare staff to perform their hired responsibilities while providing your patients with efficient, considerate, and knowledgeable support whenever they need it. BPO healthcare call centers can handle everything communication-related, like appointment management, incoming inquiries, and <a href="https://www.teledirect.com/services/outbound/">outbound communication</a> like test results and other follow-up calls.</p>
<p>With TeleDirect, we make that easy. We offer scalable <a href="https://www.teledirect.com/services/small-business-call-center/">call center options for small practices</a>, large hospitals, and everything in between — and we are available across the entire United States. Plus, we offer 24/7 coverage, so your patients never have to wait until morning (or Monday) to address their needs. We have also perfected the art of <a href="https://www.teledirect.com/blog/call-center-script-vs-call-flow/">call flow for call center</a> purposes, meaning patients will always be treated with respect and dignity — and their calls will always end up in the correct department. No wasted time. No fuss. No stress. That’s the way customer service should be.</p>
<h2>Customer Service in the Medical Office: Challenges and Solutions</h2>
<p>Providing top-notch customer service in medical offices and other healthcare settings can be challenging, but we can help you overcome those tribulations. Below, we will discuss two of the most pressing challenges regarding customer service in medicine and provide helpful solutions.</p>
<h3>Complex Healthcare Systems and Processes</h3>
<p>Healthcare management systems can be pretty technical and tricky to navigate. This can lead to problems like lost paperwork, missed appointments and mixed files. These issues are big “customer service” red flags that can be avoided. The best way to deal with this challenge is by outsourcing your support and administrative services to a company that provides complete <a href="https://www.teledirect.com/services/call-center-platform">call center solutions</a>, like TeleDirect. Our call center platform makes your practice’s technical and administrative side easy and accessible.</p>
<h3>Limited Resources and Funding</h3>
<p>Many healthcare systems struggle with customer service because they are underfunded and do their best with a limited budget. That’s why we recommend working with a flexible and scalable BPO call center. They will work within your budget to provide the exact amount of support you need at a specific time. During busier periods, we will take pressure off your internal team and allow for a smoother internal experience. During slower times, we can step back until you are ready for our services again.</p>
<h2>Your Patients Deserve the Best</h2>

We can talk about your practice, needs, and challenges with providing great customer service.

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Discover the difference between multichannel and omnichannel contact center services. Learn how businesses can use each approach to engage with customers across channels and improve customer satisfaction.</p>
<h2>Multichannel vs. Omnichannel Contact Center: What Is the Difference?</h2>
<p>As the world changes and technology advances, there are increasingly exciting opportunities for bigger, more immersive marketing campaigns. Many companies create omnichannel or multichannel strategies to achieve more brand loyalty and recognition, increased sales, and a better overall bottom line.</p>
<p>Ready to utilize these cross-channel marketing campaigns for your business? Let’s delve further into what these terms mean, how they differ, and a few ways to implement them into your marketing strategy. If you have any questions about omnichannel and multichannel marketing strategy, contact the TeleDirect team — it’s one of our specialties.</p>
<h2>Multichannel Customer Experience</h2>
<p>Multichannel marketing refers to a campaign that uses more than one “channel” to attract customers. So, let’s say you run a nail salon. If you advertise on social media but send out promotional emails and text message alerts about sales, this uses multichannel marketing. It gives your customers multiple chances to interact with your brand.</p>
<p>There are lots of benefits to multichannel marketing. It provides better brand awareness than relying only on one channel and is flexible and scalable. You can customize your multichannel marketing campaign to suit your current customer base and their needs.</p>
<p>Plenty of big brands go down the multichannel marketing route over omnichannel. A great example of this is Trader Joe’s. Sure, they have a website. Customers can pick up a little newsletter, The Fearless Flyer when they leave the store. They have a podcast, and a YouTube channel, too. But they do not, for example, have any TV ads, despite being a major national grocery store. These marketing choices work for the quirky, laid-back brand voice that Trader Joe’s has developed.</p>
<p>If your brand only utilizes one channel, it might be time to go multichannel. This can be as simple as incorporating an outbound communication service into your strategy. By outsourcing a service like this, you can create a branded <a href="https://www.teledirect.com/blog/call-center-script-vs-call-flow/">call flow for your call center</a>, allowing for a seamless and interactive customer experience.</p>
<h2>Omnichannel Customer Experience</h2>
<p>Omnichannel merchants are also referred to as geniuses in our offices. We believe that omnichannel marketing can be the key to a brilliant success in the business world. It is such a comprehensive way of marketing that has an incredibly far reach.</p>
<p>Omnichannel marketing uses every available form of media to advertise. This includes television, email, billboards, print, social media, apps, and text — you name it! Omnichannel marketing can reach leads and customers at every level — and it does. While it certainly can be a big investment for a company to engage in omnichannel marketing, there are significant returns to be had. Omnichannel marketing is a fantastic way to make your mark as a company. It can help you to ensure visibility, express your unique brand voice, and see booming business.</p>
<p>Many major brands utilize omnichannel marketing. A great example is Disney. This company is so skilled at omnichannel marketing that it can be easy to forget it is a brand. For many consumers, Disney seems more like a “feeling” or experience than a product, but it is still 100% a brand. Disney advertises across every platform, from social media to traditional television commercials.</p>
<p>Implementing an omnichannel marketing campaign is a big undertaking and requires serious planning and collaboration. We highly recommend working with industry professionals across intended channels. For instance, a creative agency will be able to tackle your social media and design needs, while a call center will handle outgoing and support-based communication with branded scripting. Outsourcing these roles will help ensure your big rollout is smooth and professional.</p>
<h2>Multichannel vs. Omnichannel: Key Differences</h2>
<p>The key difference between these two forms of marketing comes down to scale. Multichannel marketing is any campaign that relies on more than one advertising channel. This means that omnichannel marketing encompasses all the available advertising channels and is a large-scale form of multichannel marketing. Companies may begin utilizing a multichannel marketing strategy but eventually, expand to an omnichannel solution.</p>
<h2>Choosing the Right Approach</h2>
<p>The amount and types of channels that your company wishes to utilize will ultimately be a personal decision. Depending on your budget, industry, current demand, and target audience, you might find that the multichannel or omnichannel route is better for your bottom line.</p>
<p>Whether your business plans to engage in multichannel or omnichannel marketing, your best way forward is through outsourcing. At TeleDirect, we make your rollout easy by offering <a href="https://www.teledirect.com/services/small-business-call-center/">call center services for small businesses</a> and larger ones.

We even work with your team to learn your verbiage and values to create customized scripts, offering customers a curated brand experience.</p>

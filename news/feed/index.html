<h2><b>Modern Healthcare Telehealth</b><b>: Trends to Watch in 2022 and Beyond</b></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So just how big is telehealth technology in healthcare? Consider this: early COVID-19 pandemic statistics showed that telehealth visits were<a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/healthcare-systems-and-services/our-insights/telehealth-a-quarter-trillion-dollar-post-covid-19-reality" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> nearly 80 times higher</a> than pre-pandemic levels. Partly due to patient demand and also because of significant investment in telehealth trend in healthcare, it’s safe to stay telehealth will remain an integral part of the entire healthcare continuum moving forward.</p>
<p>But which trends in modern healthcare telehealth will define the next decade or so?</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Mental health services</b>. Telehealth technology in healthcare fits typical mental health counsel – personalized attention, one-one-one communication, distraction-free environments – about as well as any other medium. As the need for mental health care increases, expect the<a href="https://www.teledirect.com/industries/healthcare/"> healthcare industry</a> to bolster their telehealth services. This segment should outpace other types of telehealth services in the near and long-term.</li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Significant cost savings</b>. According to a recent study, telemedicine and related telehealth services<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2021/11/18/digital-transformation-trends-in-healthcare-to-watch-in-2021/?sh=11841c85557e" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> save healthcare providers up to $1,500 per visit</a>. Multiply that millions, and it’s easy to see this telehealth trend in healthcare continuing – and improving – for the foreseeable future.</li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Enhanced data integration</b>. The ability for telehealth applications to distribute useful information will define telehealth services – and also enhance their overall efficacy. Which means the need for rock-solid,<a href="https://www.teledirect.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/HIPAA_Security_Rule_Standard.pdf"> secure HIPAA protocols</a> is greater than ever.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Enjoy the Advantages of Outsourcing Customer Service | Discover the Benefits of a Call Center to Your Business | Call TeleDirect Today for Business Improvement Strategy and Solutions!</strong></p>
<p>It wasn’t too long ago that companies set the rules regarding when and where they did business. If customers wanted to buy a product or service, they had to get to the place of business during open hours or go without. Even if they ordered by phone, they still had to call during the company’s prescribed hours of operation, which were usually set up for the convenience of the business rather than the customer. In a way, business was limited to geographical and time constraints.</p>
<p>These days, not so much.</p>
<p>Thanks to the Internet, social media and increased global competition, today’s consumers decide when and where they will purchase a product or service. If your business doesn’t adapt to their preferences, they’ll find a competitor who will. There’s always a better solution online, at least from your customer’s point of view. That’s why constant business improvement should be part of your gameplan.</p>
<p>To thrive in this new environment, where consumers increasingly dictate how, when and where they will buy, more and more companies are taking advantage of <a href="https://www.teledirect.com/services/inbound/">outsourced call center customer services</a> – including those that operate 24/7. Not sure how to grow your business? <a href="https://www.teledirect.com/">TeleDirect’s</a> complete solutions show you the benefits of outsourcing call center services &#8211; and much more!</p>
<p>Customer service doesn’t always adhere to a strict 9 to 5 schedule. Just some of the customer service demands today include:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Round-the-clock feedback</b>. Your products and services are always in the spotlight. When your customers feel the need to comment or provide feedback – which can be anytime – your 24/7 call center should have the <a href="https://www.teledirect.com/services/inbound/">inbound capacity</a> to handle this communication, along with practical <a href="https://www.teledirect.com/services/outbound/">outbound solutions</a> in place to effectively manage your brand. Feedback is a critical element of effective business improvement strategies &#8211; call TeleDirect today and see how we can help!</li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Hidden sales opportunities</b>. From existing clients to would-be customers, your communication platform must perform round the clock. If not, you might as well sign your customers over to the competition. With <a href="https://www.teledirect.com/services/lead-response-management/">lead response management</a> services for a variety of industries, 24/7 contact center operation is simply easier – and more sales-friendly – with TeleDirect. This bottom line-focused strategy is just one of the many benefits of outsourcing call center services</li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Automated reservations</b>. After-hours scheduling can be a challenge for both businesses and non-profits. With TeleDirect’s built-in call center tools and <a href="https://www.teledirect.com/services/inbound/reservation-services/">reservation services</a>, our live agent support and robust infrastructure gives your 24/7 call center added functionality when you need it most – so you can focus on more critical needs. With TeleDirect’s business process outsourcing (BPO) 24/7 contact center services in your corner, reservations happen automatically, whether you opt for our highly trained staff or streamlined, reliable software.</li>
</ul>
<p>From social media messaging to traditional telephone communication, you have to be able to reach your customers around the clock, on both <a href="https://www.teledirect.com/services/inbound/">inbound </a>and <a href="https://www.teledirect.com/services/outbound/">outbound </a> avenues. Give your 24/7 contact center the support it needs – and the peace of mind necessary to concentrate on what makes your business unique. Contact TeleDirect today and put the benefits of outsourcing call center services to work for you.</p>
<h2><b>The Benefits of Outsourcing Call Center Services</b></h2>
<p>Call centers offer many benefits to companies that depend on phone contact with prospects and customers to drive revenues and grow the business. These include:</p>
<h3><b>Superior customer service.</b></h3>
<p>There are plenty of advantages of outsourcing customer service. As already mentioned, today’s consumers expect to be able to buy products and services at any hour of the day or night. They also expect to receive help when they need it. Whether it’s returning a product, seeking technical support, resolving problems with billing, or simply seeking information about a product or service, they want to do it on <i>their</i> schedule, not yours.</p>
<p>Bad customer service drives away clients and diminishes your brand. <a href="https://www.teledirect.com/services/inbound/customer-service/">Superior customer service</a> sets you apart from the competition and increases client retention. With a <a href="https://www.teledirect.com/services/24-7-call-center-services/">24/7 call center</a> trained in the nuances of your products, services and business model, you can deliver an exemplary customer service experience every time, all while focusing on what you do best &#8211; provide products and services to  your customers. Let TeleDirect handle your call center tasks, and see the advantages of outsourcing customer service!</p>
<p>Just some of the numerous benefits of outsourcing call center services with TeleDirect include:</p>
<h3><b>Increased sales results.</b></h3>
<p>The “instant gratification” mentality of today’s consumers applies to sales as well as customer service. Suppose someone decides they must have your product at 10:00 p.m. or in another time zone halfway around the world. If you’re not open for business, that prospective customer will find a competitor that is. Many surveys show that 9 in 10 customers won’t leave a voicemail when considering purchases. With a 24/7 call center, queued customers are more likely to become paying customers!</p>
<p>Equally important, a 24-hour answering service gives you round-the-clock access to your customers. Engaging directly with customers is the most effective way to increase sales. With a 24/7 call center, you can generate more leads and close more sales through personalized interaction with your target market.</p>
<h3><b>Live operators make the difference.</b></h3>
<p>Today’s consumers hate automated phone systems and voice mail. A 24/7 call center gives you well-trained operators who know how to answer questions, resolve customer service issues and increase sales in a timely and professional manner. Live operators can perform a wide variety of tasks to improve customer service and satisfaction:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Answering general inbound calls</li>
<li aria-level="1"><a href="https://www.teledirect.com/services/outbound/#">Making outbound calls</a></li>
<li aria-level="1">Web-generated lead follow up</li>
<li aria-level="1">Handling customer complaints</li>
<li aria-level="1"><a href="https://www.teledirect.com/services/outbound/appointment-setting-services/">Setting appointments</a></li>
<li aria-level="1"><a href="https://www.teledirect.com/services/inbound/lead-qualification/">Generating leads</a></li>
<li aria-level="1"><a href="https://www.teledirect.com/services/inbound/tier-1-tech-support/">Providing technical support</a></li>
<li aria-level="1">Taking reservations for seminars and other events</li>
<li aria-level="1">Providing emergency response services</li>
</ul>
<p>TeleDirect’s top-trained, professional agents  also add a personal touch to doing business with your company. When given a choice between doing business with a friendly, well-trained professional or an impersonal answering machine, customers will choose the live operator every time.</p>
<p>TeleDirect’s motivated agents work in tandem with our call center software to provide personable and automated support for high call volume times, crisis situations like recalls, or to simply assist with your everyday business operations. 24/7 call center support with TeleDirect takes care of your most pressing contact center tasks, which enable you to give your own clients the attention they deserve. Remember, the advantages of outsourcing customer service aren’t all in automated solutions or superior backend technology. Sometimes, they’re centered around a professional, courteous frontline of customer communication personnel &#8211; and that’s exactly what our agents provide!</p>
<h3><b>Improved productivity and reduced operating costs.</b></h3>
<p>Every business strives to find the right balance between providing great customer service and getting the work done to produce the product or service. However, training your staff to answer and manage customer calls in a professional manner involves a costly and time-consuming process. It also requires dealing with sick days, absences, vacations and other employee issues that increase staffing needs and all the costs that go along with them.</p>
<p>A reliable 24/7 call center provides a cost-effective communications solution that saves your business time and money by seamlessly executing many of your company’s routine responsibilities, such as sales, customer support, data entry, appointment-setting, after-hours dispatching and more. The call center handles everything from staffing and training call agents to providing software, technology and an off-site call center – so you don’t have to. As a result, your employees can perform their jobs more efficiently and focus on what they do best&#8230;and you can enjoy all the benefits of outsourcing call center services, from lower operating costs to more satisfied clients!</p>
<p>That’s just one reason that TeleDirect’s BPO 24/7 contact center platform is the preferred solution for businesses all across the United States, represented through a vast &amp; varied range of <a href="https://www.teledirect.com/industries/">industrial sectors</a>.</p>
<p><b> </b></p>
<h3><b>Grow your business by being “always on.”</b></h3>
<p>With a 24/7 call center, your company is always open for business, allowing you to provide excellent customer service to a fast-growing generation of “I want it when I want it” consumers. Our call center is always on, including the advantages of outsourcing customer service and other business-critical tasks. With TeleDirect, your business will::</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Make customer engagement easier by providing a way to contact your business at any time, from anywhere</li>
<li aria-level="1">Expand your markets by serving customers around the world – regardless of time zones</li>
<li aria-level="1">Turn after-hours, weekends and holidays into revenue opportunities</li>
<li aria-level="1">Build your company’s brand by providing first-rate customer service</li>
<li aria-level="1">Increase customer loyalty and retention</li>
<li aria-level="1">Focus your attention and resources on growing revenues</li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Enhanced brand</b></h3>
<p>An outsourced 24/7 call center does more than just handle administrative tasks and reduce operating expenses. When your customers are given a professional, courteous, and timely greeting, your business gets an immediate boost. With a 24/7 contact center and efficient service, small businesses grow – and larger businesses gain an even larger market share, thanks to smart, streamlined 24/7 call center assistance!</p>
<h2><b>Finding the Right Call Center Provider</b></h2>
<p>Once you decide that a 24/7 call center makes sense for your business, the next step involves finding the right one for your customer communications needs. Here’s what to look for:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Experience and knowledge in your industry</li>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>People are, by nature, social animals. And that socialization is more important than you might think.</p>
<p>In so-called “normal times,” when stress levels are already somewhat high, relationships promote a sense of community and strengthen ties between family and friends.</p>
<p>2020, in case you haven’t heard, isn’t normal by any means. A year of forgettable events has been punctuated by the COVID-19 outbreak, and with it the subsequent lockdowns, skyrocketing depression, and complete disruption of the good old days. 2019 seems like a long time ago.</p>
<p>Numerous studies illustrate the importance of relationships and social support. People who don’t have ideal support are <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2921311/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prone to poor psychological and physical health</a>.</p>
<p>But what makes relationships even more critical for health and well-being, particularly during a global pandemic, is the tangible “resilience factor” promoted by a sense of belonging. Relationships actually make humans more resistant to viruses, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7345443/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as evidenced by recent COVID-19 research</a>.</p>
<p>On a personal level, strong relationships are absolutely essential in keeping a positive mindset, even when it seems like all hope is lost.</p>
<p>Likewise for the business world. Think about it – a typical day of commerce (for any industry, all across the globe) involves literally thousands of people, multi-channel communication methods, and countless cues, suggestions, promises, commitments to customer service, and more.</p>
<p>In other words, relationships are EVERYTHING in business. Relationships are the foundation of commerce, the rock-solid framework that holds together client-business trust, regardless of your particular field. That’s why <a href="https://www.teledirect.com/">TeleDirect’s</a> business process outsourcing (BPO) services, from <a href="https://www.teledirect.com/services/inbound/">superior inbound capability</a> to a proven <a href="https://www.teledirect.com/services/call-center-platform/">call center platform</a>, are important for keeping your business relationships thriving, even in unprecedented times.</p>
<p>TeleDirect’s pro-business relationship BPO services include everything from <a href="https://www.teledirect.com/services/inbound/reservation-services/">reservation services</a> to <a href="https://www.teledirect.com/services/inbound/direct-response/">direct response</a> and even live agents for a much-needed personal (and personable) touch to your call center needs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Read enough articles about <a href="https://www.teledirect.com/services/call-center-platform/">call center platforms</a> and <a href="https://www.teledirect.com/services/inbound/customer-service/">customer service systems</a> nowadays, and it would appear that robots – in the form of integrated automated response applications, including chatbots – are primed to replace humans as the preferred mode of contact.</p>
<p>But is that really the case?</p>
<p>Let’s take a typical customer outreach scenario. A client isn’t completely satisfied with the product they bought. Or, they have a question about a particular service plan. The next logical step is a call to customer service.</p>
<p>Expecting a friendly, knowledgeable agent to address their concerns, they’re instead presented with an automated answering service. So much for personalized attention!</p>
<p>A similar glitch in client communication occurs with chatbots. When inbound client outreach happens with a chat portal, the last thing many customers want to see is the customary, cold boilerplate that basically says, “Hi! I’m a robot. A real person isn’t available right now, so I’ll use keywords, algorithms and scientific data analysis to try and figure out your problem. Let’s go!”</p>
<p>Simply put, the so-called “robotic revolution” for inbound customer contact portals isn’t coming anytime soon. Customers definitely prefer an empathetic, intuitive live agent to handle their issues.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.teledirect.com/">TeleDirect</a> assists with all of your outreach requirements, both automated and live agent support. Our business processing outsourced (BPO) solutions also offer a complete, value-added assortment of business-boosting tools and resources (<a href="https://www.teledirect.com/services/inbound/direct-response/">direct response &amp; media support</a>, <a href="https://www.teledirect.com/services/inbound/tier-1-tech-support/">help desk assistance</a>, etc.) to offer <a href="https://www.teledirect.com/industries/">premium ROI for any industry</a> – including yours!</p>
<p>But back to the question at hand: how close are we, really, to the incoming automated takeover?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Case for Live Agent Support</strong></p>
<p>Let’s be clear about automated response systems: there’s a time and place for them in many customer contact portals, particularly for large-scale enterprises that require 24/7/365 response capability.</p>
<p>As far as cost savings, chatbots – the so-called “robots” of the call center world – offer significant savings over traditional agent-associated expenses. For example, many companies can save <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blogs/watson/2017/10/how-chatbots-reduce-customer-service-costs-by-30-percent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over 25% of their customer service budget</a> with strategically deployed chatbot interfaces.</p>
<p>But at what cost to overall customer confidence? For general inquires (hours of operation, discount details, etc.), chatbots and other robotic communication means are perfectly fine. But when the situation demands a real human being to step in and assuage doubt and reassure clients about your products and services, it’s hard to top a live agent.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a personal, human touch to your customer communication strategy, look no further than TeleDirect. Our fully-trained, professional agents are ready to step in at a moment’s notice, regardless of your particular business continuum.</p>
<p>What’s more, it’s not as if chatbot communication systems run on autopilot all the time. A fine-tuned, delicate maintenance program must keep everything running smoothly all the time. If there’s a problem with your chatbot system, an immediate fix is required. Without it, you might as well have a busy signal to answer customer calls.</p>
<p>We recommend an optimal blend of chatbots and live agents to handle your client communication, particularly on the <a href="https://www.teledirect.com/services/inbound/">inbound side</a>. For Tier 1 tech support whenever you need it, TeleDirect is the outsourced solution of choice. Our <a href="https://www.teledirect.com/services/inbound/tier-1-tech-support/">Tier 1 platform</a> provides 24/7 support in our U.S. based call center, handling everything from time-sensitive new product deployments to legacy communication requirements.  All of our Tier 1 initiatives are determined by your specific needs – and spearheaded by our professional, fully capable agents.</p>

To speak with our live agent support specialists and BPO experts, you can also call TeleDirect directly at (800) 776-1081.

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Healthcare is personal by its very nature. The relationships between patients and caregivers – doctors, nurses, aides, and countless other providers – are the foundation of positive, meaningful healthcare experiences.</p>
<p>And that’s precisely why some healthcare organizations are reluctant to implement virtual contact centers. Healthcare personnel are rightly concerned about how they can still offer personalized, patient-friendly service for a variety of processes, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Appointments</li>
<li>Scheduled follow-up visits</li>
<li>Telehealth services (in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak, an increasingly convenient and safe method of patient care)</li>
<li>Doctor’s visit information (test results, prognosis, diagnosis, etc.)</li>
<li>Switching doctors and other healthcare providers</li>
<li>Managing HIPAA guidelines (in other words, the integrity and security of sensitive patient information)</li>
<li>And much more</li>
</ul>
<p>With an online-based customer (and patient) contact portal, along with an array of resources to bolster communication, <a href="https://www.teledirect.com/">TeleDirect </a>has a solution in store for your healthcare virtual contact center.</p>
<p>From insurance to manufacturing and a <a href="https://www.teledirect.com/industries/">host of other industries</a>, TeleDirect provides practical, customized contact center solutions, all with the convenience and flexibility to implement customer-friendly platforms. The healthcare industry is no different – and given the enormous challenges in the age of widespread pandemics, our turnkey <a href="https://www.teledirect.com/business-solutions/the-importance-of-redundancy-for-business-continuity/">healthcare call center services</a> are a great way to manage your patient outreach strategy, especially in the face of COVID-19.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Virtual Contact Center Guidelines</strong></p>
<p>One of the big advantages of a competent, fully capable virtual contact center is the sheer volume of calls and communication channels it can handle. Any health crisis creates an instant spike in patient-healthcare provider interaction.</p>
<p>But that’s not all; in order to fully ensure your virtual contact center is ready for anything, here are some things you can do to bolster call platform productivity. TeleDirect can help with the following process as well:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify critical COVID-19 related requests across your entire healthcare continuum (triage, emergency care centers, urgent care, offices, etc.).</li>
<li>Build and support a reliable cloud-based contact platform that encourages social distancing and enhanced personal safety for contact center personnel and support staff, even while providing the same level of care your patients expect. This is one of the most important elements of any <a href="https://www.teledirect.com/business-solutions/the-importance-of-redundancy-for-business-continuity/">healthcare call center</a>, particularly for COVID-19.</li>
<li>Implement specialized scripts and other communication methods related to COVID-19 requirements. These include queries related to recent travel, known exposure, and more.</li>
<li>Review and analyze quality assurance polices to address normal healthcare needs along with COVID-19 communication protocols.</li>
<li>Create a helpful frequently asked questions (FAQ) page for patients to gather information during off-hours.</li>
<li>Offer additional office hours or additional support personnel to handle extra capacity. TeleDirect provides <a href="https://www.teledirect.com/value-results/">professionally trained agents </a>to help with considerable volume and patient demand.</li>
<li>Track key performance metrics for COVID-19 tasks and processes, and ensure visibility and action items for all relevant stakeholders.</li>
<li>Ensure redundancy and security for all patient data. Even before COVID-19, HIPAA regulations were a foremost concern for call centers. Now more than ever, <a href="https://www.teledirect.com/business-solutions/the-importance-of-redundancy-for-business-continuity/">healthcare call centers</a> require a contact portal that’s robust enough to handle large volume, yet efficient and secure enough to process patient information with the utmost integrity.</li>
</ul>
<p>As healthcare workplaces transform from an “up close and personal” model to a more remote-based way of working (think telehealth services and remote appointments), your virtual contact center will play a central role in the quality of your patient care – not to mention, total patient satisfaction. TeleDirect is here to assist with all of your virtual contact center needs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Connect with TeleDirect – Elevate Your Virtual Contact Center Today!</strong></p>
<p>Need assistance with a reliable virtual contact center? If you’d like to improve your healthcare contact center capability without sacrificing patient information security and other concerns related to the patient-care provider dynamic, TeleDirect can help today!</p>

During the current global health crisis, and for future challenges, TeleDirect will continue to provide remote, outsourced solutions for all healthcare providers.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>You Can Say that Again: The Importance of Redundancy for Business Continuity</strong></p>
<p>Now more than ever, remote-based business processing outsourcing (BPO) services are essential for businesses and non-profits to handle everything from customer service to lead generation.</p>
<p>In the face of the COVID-19 global pandemic, it’s very much business as usual for certain sectors of the economy. The headlines focus on soaring jobless claims and shuttered businesses, but domestic and global commerce are far from unplugged. For businesses with cloud-based applications and services, everyday business activities continue apace, even as normal operational protocols are disrupted on a daily (and sometimes hourly) basis.</p>
<p>How has the worldwide economy continued to function, even at a diminished capacity? Automated processes, courtesy of BPO providers like <a href="https://www.teledirect.com/">TeleDirect</a>, lead the way with innovative, unmatched redundancy for a <a href="https://www.teledirect.com/industries/">variety of industries</a> and business tasks.</p>
<p><strong>The Department of Redundancy Department: Bolster Your Business Structure with a Solid Backup Plan</strong></p>
<p>Redundancy is important for servers, particularly when multiple data servers – spread across different locations – are required to deliver speed, performance, and reliability. Given the current environment of social distancing and ultra-cautious personal interactions, it’s imperative to have your data secure and, more importantly, instantly accessible.</p>
<p>Disaster inevitably strikes. Exhibit A: COVID-19. Is your enterprise prepared with rapid, reliable business continuity planning? TeleDirect shows the way with first-rate security and redundancy for your entire communication platform and much more. Our flexible, agile <a href="https://www.teledirect.com/services/call-center-platform/">call center platform</a> features world-class cloud computing services for all of your custom requirements – for “normal” business periods, critical COVID 19-sensitive data processing, and everything in between.</p>
<p>We’ve built our hard-earned reputation with superior BPO services, based on fault-tolerant web architectures, strategic cloud services and Amazon Web Services (AWS) to ensure anytime connectivity and unmatched reliability. Experience a BPO solution that’s robust enough in times of crisis, and sophisticated enough to optimize overall resources for the best possible bottom line results.</p>
<p><strong>Sign Up with TeleDirect: Best-in-Class Redundancy, Seamless Business Continuity &amp; More!</strong></p>

Unemployment rates are <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-10/economists-see-drawn-out-u-s-recovery-after-unemployment-surge" target="_blank" rel="noopener">approaching Great Depression levels</a>. The worldwide economy seems stuck in quicksand. Confidence is shaken. Local, state, and national governments continue to weigh the ideal timing to reopen economic activity.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Watch enough science fiction movies or read the latest news, and you’d think robots – namely, machines using artificial intelligence (AI) – are ready to take over the world…including customer service platforms like the call center.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But the seemingly inevitable handover of customer service tasks from humans to AI-powered data centers isn’t all it’s cracked up to be.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To paraphrase Bart Simpson: “I, for one, welcome our new AI overlords – but not yet!”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As a leading business process outsourcing (BPO) provider for the call center industry, <a href="https://www.teledirect.com/"><span class="s2">TeleDirect </span></a>knows all about the supposed obsolescence of live agents – and we’re here to say, nothing could be further from the truth. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In fact, based on informed projections from a few industry insiders and human experience studies, it looks like AI will simply enhance the ability of professional live agents to do their jobs more efficiently – the best of both worlds!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>The Coming AI Explosion for Call Centers: More Complementary Than Revolutionary</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A few years back, Salesforce and Google combined to enhance customer service responsiveness with intuitive, more intelligent contact platforms. T<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/10/salesforce-and-google-want-to-build-a-smarter-customer-service-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s2">aking Salesforce’s considerable acquired knowledge and Google’s powerful AI enterprise</span></a>, representative were able to show how AI can make the human experience for customers more reliable, timely, and ultimately satisfying.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Since that 2017 collaboration, it looks increasingly likely that AI chatbots aren’t quite ready to grab the customer service torch. Rather, AI is the perfect complementary element for effective, streamlined human interaction.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Why will AI enhance, not replace, professional live agents?</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1"><b>Costs</b>. As much as conventional wisdom has you believe that it’s inefficient to have an all-human customer service staff, the costs (salary, benefits, you name it) usually pale in comparison to a full-blown, AI-driven, automated call center platform. And that’s one great thing about TeleDirect – with our <a href="https://www.teledirect.com/value-results/"><span class="s2">value and results-based approach</span></a> to call centers and other BPO services, every client can customize exactly how much automation they’d like to implement!</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1"><b>People prefer people.</b> Breaking news: most people who call a customer service line are disappointed with an AI-intensive, automated platform. There’s nothing quite like an actual human on the other end of the line to address their concerns!</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1"><b>Lagging technology</b>. AI is constantly touted as the next big thing in streamlined customer service. And while certain elements (chatbots and analytics, for example) are certainly impressive, the technology isn’t up to speed yet. Case in point: real human interaction (see above) requires a real human response to fully inform AND empathize. Think that fancy AI system knows all the sophisticated inflections, pauses, and slang of genuine person-to-person interaction? Think again.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1"><b>Blended is better</b>. Since the dawn of the call center – particularly traditional <a href="https://www.teledirect.com/services/inbound/"><span class="s2">inbound activities</span></a> – the live agent has been the star of the show. Humans aren’t going away from essential customer service duties. But with a vast database and SOME automated responses for certain questions, a perfect combination of live agents and AI-based interaction is emerging as the optimal way to handle customer requests and questions.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Get in Touch with TeleDirect Today: Enjoy Full-Service Live Agents, Professional Outsourcing &amp; More!</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Clearly, humans are sticking around. And TeleDirect is here to get your call center off the ground. Whether your enterprise needs precise enhancements or system-wide, turnkey solutions, we’re here to help. Complete our <a href="https://www.teledirect.com/#contact-form"><span class="s2">customer contact form</span></a> and one of our live agent – AI consultants will discuss solutions that fit any budget.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Technology has transformed practically every corner of life. Call centers are no different. Today, customers expect lightning-fast response times. Yet back in the day, holding for 10, 15 or even 30 minutes wasn’t unheard of.</p>
<p>So how did we get from there to here? Let’s jump in our time machine and take a trip down memory lane – you’ll be surprised at how far the call center has come!</p>

<h3>Switchboards – The Call Center Stone Age</h3>
<ul>
<li>In the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, switchboards functioned as de facto call centers. Human error, unreliable technology, and other hurdles ensured the first call center was no place to expect quick service!</li>
</ul>
<h3>Computer-Based Call Answering</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mid 1950s</strong> – in the mid-20<sup>th</sup> century, a system called the Automatic Call Distributor (ACD) collected, routed, and assigned incoming calls to available agents. It wasn’t the most effective or efficient method, but the present-day call center had its first prototype. The use of algorithms started the transition from switchboards to premise-based call centers.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Early Call Center Precursors</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Late 1950s / early 1960s</strong> – the blueprint for the modern call center was created with Private Automated Business Exchanges (known as PABX). Of course, PABX enterprises relied heavily on ACD technology.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The 1-800 Era</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Late 1960s</strong> – to make call routing easier, AT&amp;T established 1-800 numbers in 1967. This allowed heavier call volumes, and also created unexpected advertising opportunities and marketing avenues.</li>
</ul>
<h3>British Advancements – How to Answer the Telly 20,000 Times per Week</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Early 1970s</strong> – British Gas used an ACD system to field up to 20,000 calls per week in a facility based in Wales. To date, this was the most calls any center had processed in a 7-day span.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Talking Robots (Sort of)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>1970s</strong> – with Interactive Voice Response (IVR) technology, incoming calls could be handled by fully automated systems.</li>
</ul>
<h3>To the Cloud (and Beyond)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Mid 2000s – premise-based call center technology eventually ceded call center management to cloud-based systems. TeleDirect was one of the early pioneers in this field, with a <a href="https://www.teledirect.com/value-results/">global cloud infrastructure</a> powered by Amazon Web Services and Twilio.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There you have it – a brief history of call center technology. So the next time you reach out to a call center and receive prompt, customer-friendly service, thank those trailblazers like ACD, PABX, IVR and other technology for getting things headed in the right direction. If you still feel your business is operating out of a switchboard, it may be time to seek professional help.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the telecommunications industry, the “communication” part isn’t always easy, especially between providers and clients. Sometimes, an unorthodox approach is desired – even necessary. The present state of virtual communications – building trust and ensuring satisfaction without actual face-to-face meetings – provides plenty of challenges, but three different companies (<a href="https://www.teledirect.com/">TeleDirect</a>, <a href="https://www.messagingservice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Access Direct</a> and <a href="https://globafone.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Globafone</a>) have managed to thrive in this ever-perilous environment.</p>
<p>Smitha Baliga (CEO of TeleDirect), John Kinskey (President &amp; Founder of Access Direct) and Louis Altman (Founder &amp; CEOI of Globafone) recently spoke about building relationships with customers, delivering top-notch customer service and the keys to making virtual communications work.</p>
<h2>How important is customer service?</h2>
<p>Smitha Baliga, CEO of TeleDirect, believes that good customer service isn’t just important, it’s vital. According to Ms. Baliga, “Irrespective of the size of your business, good customer service needs to be at the heart of your business model if you wish to be successful. Good customer service leads to customer satisfaction which can generate positive word-of-mouth for your business and help your business grow and prosper. Customers are willing to pay more for a better experience. It reflects heavily on your entire business and is a great marketing tool.”</p>
<p>TeleDirect also stresses the “The Moment of Truth,” the critical and definitive moment when their client’s customers engage with their call center personnel for the first time. You never get a second chance to make a first impression, as the saying goes, and TeleDirect uses this urgency to improve their customer service model.</p>
<p><strong>John Kinskey</strong>, President and Founder of Access Direct, uses customer service to distinguish his company’s services from industry competitors. According to Mr. Kinskey, “I have always felt that our customer service sets us apart from the other companies in our field. Many large companies offering virtual phone systems for small businesses do so with a hands-off approach, expecting all small business owners to be fluent in the technical side of the business as well as running the business itself. This hands-off approach may work for a large company with a dedicated IT staff, but for a one-to-five-person business, it can be a very high bar to clear.”</p>
<p>A dedicated support team is also crucial for Access Direct’s success. With a dedicated support team, the company provides value and shows commitment to their client’s success. Plus, this “go the extra mile” mentality also reduces the initial pressure of learning a new system. For a busy client, that type of service is hard to put a price tag on.</p>
<p>For some executives, customer service is everything. “It is our lifeblood,” said <strong>Louis Altman</strong>, Founder &amp; CEOI of Globafone. “If you are selling the same exact product as every competitor, you need to do something different and better and special”</p>
<p>From Mr. Altman’s perspective, price-cutting only goes so far, due to the product similarity within the telecommunication industry. That’s where superior customer service comes into play. “If your customers know you stand behind what you sell, they are willing to pay a little more,” said Mr. Altman.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Customer service and remote communication: delivering when you’re <u>not</u> up close and personal.</h2>
<p>Providing your clients and customers value – even when you’re not directly across the table – provides daily challenges to the telecommunication industry. How do business leaders bridge the gap?</p>
<p>Mr. Kinskey believes timing is crucial “Prompt response time is key. When you don’t have the customer in front of you, it’s important to reply to their concerns quickly and efficiently,” explained Mr. Kinskey. In other words, don’t let the distance scare you. It’s the time that should concern you. According to Mr. Kinskey, time is a huge trust-builder when client communication isn’t face-to-face.</p>
<p>Ms. Baliga believes that when communications aren’t face-to-face, words and tone carry all the weight. “We have our call center representatives be cheerful and polite when they talk.  Smiling when you talk on the phone helps your voice to sound friendly, warm and receptive. TeleDirect believes in prompt and effective communication with our clients. Our client support team is in constant touch with our clients and they work on providing timely and effective solutions,” said Ms. Baliga.</p>
<p>And don’t forget the importance of educating your customers. Globafone’s hallmark customer service includes education. “We want our clients to understand the nuances of the industry so they can make the best choice when it is time.  Free education is a HUGE differentiator as is keeping the client’s goals in mind. Customers who aren’t directly across the table benefit from learning about the industry they’re in,” said Mr. Altman. To help bolster Globafone’s educational tools, they’ve developed learning modules and other educational resources to help solidify trust and set the foundation for a long-term business relationship.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Building successful relationships with customers.</h2>
<p>Mr. Altman’s stresses a simple, straightforward approach, along with an open mind about his customers’ concerns. “Focus on their goals and find the solution that solves the problem. Listen, acknowledge, and always offer help,” Mr. Altman said. For Globafone, this also involves utilizing their considerable educational resources. The company makes an effort to enhance the educational process, which complements their new products and services. Customer loyalty should also be recognized and rewarded. “When there is a better deal, give it to them.  The longer a client stays, the better deal they get,” concluded Mr. Altman.</p>
<p>In order to build a strong relationship with your customer, you need to know your customer – which involves listening. “Honestly, it’s as easy as that,” said Mr. Kinskey. “Listen to their concerns; really hear what they are saying; and absorb that knowledge and refer to it during interactions with that customer. An effective solution to customer concerns starts with an attentive ear.”</p>
<p>“Trust, integrity and commitment are essential ingredients for successful long-term relationships. TeleDirect has always had a singular vision &#8211; to create a business where the customer comes first. We have strived every day to meet this vision, and to build our team with this mantra always in mind. At TeleDirect, we take the time to learn and understand our customers. We practice active listening skills, and provide effective solutions to our clients. We always have the client’s best interest in mind. Loyal customers are your best sales people”, said Ms. Baliga.</p>
